1,Plasma levels of E-selectin are associated with retinopathy in sickle cell disease,2023,European Journal of Haematology,"Background: The vascular endothelium is markedly disrupted in sickle cell disease (SCD) and is the converging cascade of the complex pathophysiologic processes linked to sickle cell vasculopathy. Circulating endothelial activation and/or apoptotic markers may reflect this endothelial activation/damage that contributes to the pathophysiology of the SCD vascular complications. Methods: Plasmatic levels of circulating endothelial cells (CECs), E-selectin, progenitor's endothelial cells (EPCs), and circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) were evaluated in 50 SCD patients, 16 with vasculopathy. The association between these markers and the occurrence of disease-related microvascular injuries of the eye (retinopathy), kidney (nephropathy), and skin (chronic active ulcers) was explored. Results: Among the endothelial activation markers studied, only higher plasma levels of E-selectin were found in SCD patients with vasculopathy (p =.015). Increased E-selectin levels were associated with retinopathy (p <.001) but not with nephropathy or leg ulcers. All patients, at steady state, with or without vasculopathy, did not display a high count of CEC and EPC, markers of endothelial injury and repair. We did not show any significant differences in EVs levels between vasculopathy and not vasculopathy SCD patients. Conclusions: Further studies will be required to determine whether the E-selectin could be used as an early biomarker of retinopathy sickle cell development. © 2022 The Authors.

2,Routine Ophthalmological Examination Rates in Adults with Sickle Cell Disease Are Low and Must Be Improved,2023,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"The American Academy of Ophthalmology and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute recommend patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) undergo dilated funduscopic exams (DFE) every 1–2 years to screen for sickle retinopathy. There is a paucity of data on the adherence rate to these guidelines; a retrospective study was performed to evaluate our institution’s adherence. A chart review of 842 adults with SCD, seen 3/2017–3/2021 in the Montefiore healthcare system (All Patients), was done. Only about half of All Patients (n = 842) had >1 DFE during the study period (Total Examined Patients, n = 415). The Total Examined Patients were categorized as screening, those without retinopathy (Retinopathy−, n = 199), or follow-up, including individuals previously diagnosed with retinopathy (Retinopathy+, n = 216). Only 40.3% of screening patients (n = 87) had DFE at least biennially. As expected, there was a significant decrease in the average DFE rate of the Total Examined Patients after the COVID-19 pandemic started (13.6%) compared to pre-COVID (29.8%, p < 0.001). Similarly, there was a significant decrease in the screening rate of Retinopathy− patients from 18.6% on average pre-COVID to 6.7% during COVID (p < 0.001). This data shows the sickle retinopathy screening rate is low and innovative approaches may need to be employed to remedy this issue. © 2023 by the authors.","['blood', '  cell organelle', '  COVID-19', '  epidemic', '  health care', '  innovation', '  physiological response', '  respiratory disease', '  adult', '  aged', '  Article', '  controlled study', '  coronavirus disease 2019', '  dilated funduscopic exam', '  female', '  follow up', '  health care system', '  human', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  pandemic', '  practice guideline', '  protocol compliance', '  retinopathy', '  retrospective study', '  sickle cell anemia', '  visual system examination', '  retina disease', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  COVID-19', '  Humans', '  Pandemics', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retrospective Studies']",0.0,MDPI,English,Article,['United States'],"[Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University]",['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
3,Progress in and Prospects of Genome Editing Tools for Human Disease Model Development and Therapeutic Applications,2023,Genes,"Programmable nucleases, such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas, are widely accepted because of their diversity and enormous potential for targeted genomic modifications in eukaryotes and other animals. Moreover, rapid advances in genome editing tools have accelerated the ability to produce various genetically modified animal models for studying human diseases. Given the advances in gene editing tools, these animal models are gradually evolving toward mimicking human diseases through the introduction of human pathogenic mutations in their genome rather than the conventional gene knockout. In the present review, we summarize the current progress in and discuss the prospects for developing mouse models of human diseases and their therapeutic applications based on advances in the study of programmable nucleases. © 2023 by the authors.","['atonal BHLH transcription factor 1', '  beta actin', '  beta secretase 1', '  blood clotting factor 8', '  blood clotting factor 9', '  bone restricted ifitm like', '  chemokine receptor CCR5', '  copper zinc superoxide dismutase', '  crumbs cell polarity complex component 1', '  crystallin', '  fumarylacetoacetase', '  hemoglobin subunit gamma 1', '  huntingtin', '  hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha', '  K ras protein', '  lamin A', '  low density lipoprotein receptor', '  lymphocyte activation gene 3 protein', '  melatonin 1 receptor', '  monophenol monooxygenase', '  multidrug resistance protein 1a', '  multidrug resistance protein 1b', '  nanoparticle', '  Notch3 receptor', '  nuclease', '  octamer transcription factor 4', '  otoferlin', '  peptides and proteins', '  peripheral myelin protein 22', '  potassium channel KCNQ4', '  prestin', '  progesterone Immunomodulatory binding factor 1', '  programmed death 1 ligand 1', '  programmed death 1 receptor', '  protein Jagged 1', '  protein kinase LKB1', '  protein p53', '  RAB38 member RAS oncogene family', '  retinal pigment epithelium specific 65 kDa protein', '  RNA binding protein FUS', '  selenoprotein W', '  Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 1', '  Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2', '  tetratricopeptide repeat domain 36', '  transcription factor NANOG', '  transcription factor Sox9', '  unclassified drug', '  vasculotropin A', '  vesicular glutamate transporter 3', '  zic family member 2', '  endonuclease', '  transcription activator like effector nuclease', '  Adeno associated virus', '  age related macular degeneration', '  Alzheimer disease', '  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', '  beta thalassemia', '  cataract', '  CRISPR-CAS9 system', '  disease model', '  Duchenne muscular dystrophy', '  electroporation', '  epileptic encephalopathy', '  experimental retinopathy', '  gene', '  gene editing', '  gene knock-in', '  gene knockout', '  glycogen storage disease type 2', '  hearing impairment', '  hemophilia A', '  hemophilia B', '  hereditary motor sensory neuropathy', '  Huntington chorea', '  hyperammonemia', '  hypercholesterolemia', '  Leber congenital amaurosis', '  Lentivirus', '  lung adenocarcinoma', '  nonhuman', '  osteogenesis imperfecta', '  osteopenia', '  osteoporosis', '  pigment disorder', '  point mutation', '  progeria', '  Review', '  sickle cell anemia', '  tool use', '  tyrosinemia', '  animal', '  CRISPR Cas system', '  genetics', '  genome', '  human', '  mouse', '  Animals', '  CRISPR-Cas Systems', '  Endonucleases', '  Gene Editing', '  Genome', '  Humans', '  Mice', '  Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases']",0.0,MDPI,English,Review,['South Korea'],[National Research Foundation],[],2014 - 2023,1

5,Feature preserving mesh network for semantic segmentation of retinal vasculature to support ophthalmic disease analysis,2023,Frontiers in Medicine,"Introduction: Ophthalmic diseases are approaching an alarming count across the globe. Typically, ophthalmologists depend on manual methods for the analysis of different ophthalmic diseases such as glaucoma, Sickle cell retinopathy (SCR), diabetic retinopathy, and hypertensive retinopathy. All these manual assessments are not reliable, time-consuming, tedious, and prone to error. Therefore, automatic methods are desirable to replace conventional approaches. The accuracy of this segmentation of these vessels using automated approaches directly depends on the quality of fundus images. Retinal vessels are assumed as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of many ophthalmic diseases. Mostly newly developed ophthalmic diseases contain minor changes in vasculature which is a critical job for the early detection and analysis of disease. Method: Several artificial intelligence-based methods suggested intelligent solutions for automated retinal vessel detection. However, existing methods exhibited significant limitations in segmentation performance, complexity, and computational efficiency. Specifically, most of the existing methods failed in detecting small vessels owing to vanishing gradient problems. To overcome the stated problems, an intelligence-based automated shallow network with high performance and low cost is designed named Feature Preserving Mesh Network (FPM-Net) for the accurate segmentation of retinal vessels. FPM-Net employs a feature-preserving block that preserves the spatial features and helps in maintaining a better segmentation performance. Similarly, FPM-Net architecture uses a series of feature concatenation that also boosts the overall segmentation performance. Finally, preserved features, low-level input image information, and up-sampled spatial features are aggregated at the final concatenation stage for improved pixel prediction accuracy. The technique is reliable since it performs better on the DRIVE database, CHASE-DB1 database, and STARE dataset. Results and discussion: Experimental outcomes confirm that FPM-Net outperforms state-of-the-art techniques with superior computational efficiency. In addition, presented results are achieved without using any preprocessing or postprocessing scheme. Our proposed method FPM-Net gives improvement results which can be observed with DRIVE datasets, it gives Se, Sp, and Acc as 0.8285, 0.98270, 0.92920, for CHASE-DB1 dataset 0.8219, 0.9840, 0.9728 and STARE datasets it produces 0.8618, 0.9819 and 0.9727 respectively. Which is a remarkable difference and enhancement as compared to the conventional methods using only 2.45 million trainable parameters.

6,Development of multi-level standards of care recommendations for sickle cell disease: Experience from SickleInAfrica,2023,Frontiers in Genetics,"Introduction: Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) causes significant morbidity and mortality particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where it contributes to early childhood deaths. There is need to standardize treatment guidelines to help improve overall SCD patient health outcomes. We set out to review existing guidelines on SCD and to set minimum standards for management of SCD for the different referral levels of healthcare. Methods: A standards of care working group (SoC-WG) was established to develop the SoC recommendations. About 15 available SCD management guidelines and protocols were reviewed and themes extracted from them. The first draft was on chosen themes with 64 major headings and subtopics. Using a summarised WHO levels of referral document, we were able to get six different referral levels of healthcare. The highest referral level was the tertiary facilities whilst the lowest level was the home setting. Recommendations for SCD management for the regional, district, sub-districts, health posts and CHPs compounds were also drafted. Results: The results from this review yielded a guidelines document which had recommendations for management of SCD on 64 topics and subtopic for all the six (6) different referral levels. Discussions: Every child with SCD need to receive comprehensive care that is coordinated at each level. This recommendation is unique in terms of the availability of recommendations for different levels of care as compared to the traditional guidelines which is more focused at the tertiary levels. Patients can access care at any of the other lower referral hospitals and be managed with recommendations that are in keeping with institutional resources at that level. When such patients need care that requires expertise that is not available at that level, the recommendations will be to refer to the appropriate referral level where those expertise are available. This encourages patients to have good clinical care nearer their homes but also having access to specialist screening modalities and expertise at the tertiary hospitals if need be. With this, patient are not limited to a specific referral level when interventions cannot be instituted for them. Conclusion: This SoC recommendations document is a useful material that can be used for consistent standards of treatment in SSA.

7,Proliferative Sickle Cell Retinopathy in the Retinal Periphery Detected by Ultra-Widefield Imaging: A Case Report,2023,Case Reports in Ophthalmology,"Sickle cell proliferative retinopathy usually presents first in the peripheral retina and the ability to extend and enhance our visualization of the peripheral retina would allow for superior clinical decision-making. In our practice, we had a 28-year-old patient diagnosed with major sickle cell disease of the homozygous type SS (HbSS) that presented with sickle cell proliferative retinopathy detected by ultra-widefield imaging in the nasal side of the left fundus. At follow-up, neovascularization was detected in the extreme nasal periphery of the left eye by ultra-widefield imaging fluorescein angiography with right gaze. The case was graded as Goldberg stage 3, and the patient was administered photocoagulation treatment. With further advancements in the quality and modality of peripheral retinal imaging, novel proliferative lesions can be detected and appropriately managed much earlier than was previously possible. Ultra-widefield imaging allows for the visualization of the central 200 degrees of the retina but, with gaze view, peripheral retina beyond 200 degrees can be reached. © 2023 Authors.

8,Widefield oct-angiography-based classification of sickle cell retinopathy,2023,Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology,"Purpose: To assess the capillary non-perfusion in different concentric sectors on widefield optical coherence tomography angiography (WF-OCTA) and to correlate the ratio of non-perfusion (RNP) to the severity of sickle cell retinopathy (SCR). Methods: This retrospective, cross-sectional study included eyes of patients with various sickle cell disease (SCD) genotypes having undergone WF-OCTA and ultra-widefield color fundus photography (UWF-CFP). Eyes were grouped as no SCR, non-proliferative SCR or proliferative SCR. RNP was assessed on WF-OCTA montage in different field-of-view (FOV) sectors centered on the fovea: 0–10-degrees circle excluding the foveal avascular zone, the 10–30-degrees circle excluding the optic nerve, the 30–60-degrees circle, and the full 60-degrees circle. Results: Forty-two eyes of twenty-eight patients were included. Within each SCR group, mean RNP of the FOV 30–60 sector was higher than all other sectors (p < 0.05). Mean RNP of all sectors were significatively different between no SCR group and proliferative SCR group (p < 0.05). To distinguish no SCR versus non-proliferative SCR FOV 30–60 had a good sensitivity and specificity of 41.67% and 93.33%, respectively (cutoff RNP > 22.72%, AUC = 0.75, 95% CI 0.56–0.94, p = 0.028). To differentiate non-proliferative versus proliferative SCR, FOV 0–10 had good sensitivity and specificity of 33.33% and 91.67%, respectively (cutoff RNP > 18.09, AUC = 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.93, p = 0.041). To discern no SCR versus proliferative SCR, all sectors had optimal sensitivity and specificity (p < 0.05). Conclusion: WF OCTA-based RNP provides non-invasive diagnostic information regarding the presence and severity of SCR, and correlates with disease stage in certain FOV sectors.

9,Comparative transcriptome analysis of endothelial progenitor cells of HbSS patients with and without proliferative retinopathy,2023,Experimental Biology and Medicine,"Among sickle cell anemia (SCA) complications, proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (PSCR) is one of the most important, being responsible for visual impairment in 10–20% of affected eyes. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) present in pathways that may be implicated in the pathophysiology of PSCR from the transcriptome profile analysis of endothelial progenitor cells. RNA-Seq was used to compare gene expression profile of circulating endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) from HbSS patients with and without PSCR. Furthermore, functional enrichment analysis and protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks were performed to gain further insights into biological functions. The differential expression analysis identified 501 DEGs, when comparing the groups with and without PSCR. Furthermore, functional enrichment analysis showed associations of the DEGs in 200 biological processes. Among these, regulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity, positive regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and positive regulation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) receptor signaling pathway were observed. These pathways are associated with angiogenesis, cell migration, adhesion, differentiation, and proliferation, important processes involved in PSCR pathophysiology. Moreover, our results showed an over-expression of VEGFC (vascular endothelial growth factor–C) and FLT1 (Fms-Related Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 1) genes, when comparing HbSS patients with and without PSCR. These results may indicate a possible association between VEGFC and FLT1 receptor, which may activate signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK and contribute to the mechanisms implicated in neovascularization. Thus, our findings contain preliminary results that may guide future studies in the field, since the molecular mechanisms of PSCR are still poorly understood. © 2023 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.",,0.0,SAGE Publications Inc.,English,Article,['Brazil'],"[Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa, Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico]",['Brazil'],2014 - 2023,1

11,Evaluation of lung function in a German single center cohort of young patients with sickle cell disease using EIT and standard techniques,2023,Frontiers in Medicine,"Background and objective: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a very common autosomal recessive hemoglobinopathy leading to multiple pulmonary complications that are closely associated with mortality. The pathophysiology of chronic pulmonary involvement is not yet fully understood and no specific therapies are available. Methods: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to characterize the lung function of children and young adolescents with SCD in a German single-center cohort and to extend conventional lung function testing by the use of a new imaging method. We performed spirometry and body plethysmography in 35 children and young adults with hemoglobin SS, SC, S/β-thalassemia as well as 50 controls. These data were compared with clinical characteristics and typical laboratory parameters of hemolysis and disease activity in SCD. To identify lung inhomogeneities, for example due to atelectasis, hyperinflation, air trapping or vascular occlusions, we used the promising new method of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and calculated global inhomogeneity indices. Results: Lung function of patients with SCD was significantly reduced compared to that of healthy controls. When the result was found to be pathological, the most commonly observed type of breathing disorder was classified as restrictive. Laboratory parameters showed typical features of SCD including decreased levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit and elevated levels of leucocytes, platelets, lactate dehydrogenase and total bilirubin. However, there was no correlation between blood values and reduced lung function. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) revealed no abnormalities in SCD patients compared to healthy controls. In particular, we were unable to demonstrate any regional inhomogeneities in lung ventilation. Conclusion: In our study, SCD patients showed impaired lung function, with a relevant percentage of patients suffering from restrictive breathing disorder. Signs of obstruction could not be detected. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) measurements revealed no unevenness that would suggest air entrapment, blockage of blood vessels, excessive inflation, obstruction, or other forms of lung disease. Additionally, the reduction in lung function observed in SCD patients was not related to the disease severity or laboratory test results.

12,HEMOGLOBIN C TRAIT PRESENTING WITH BILATERAL CENTRAL RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION,2023,Retinal Cases and Brief Reports,"Purpose:To report a case of bilateral sequential, central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in a man with newly diagnosed hemoglobin C trait.Methods:A 67-year-old man presented with a one-month history of declining visual acuity. He was diagnosed with left CRVO. Bilateral temporal retinal ischemia and arteriovenous anastomoses on fluorescein angiography suggestive of sickle cell retinopathy prompted a systemic work-up. Hemoglobin electrophoresis revealed an underlying hemoglobin C trait. Six-months after his initial presentation, the patient developed symptomatic right CRVO.Results:The initial left CRVO was complicated by optic disc swelling and macular edema. Intravitreal antiangiogenic therapy was initiated and the macular edema resolved. The left eye subsequently developed an epiretinal membrane which was surgically removed. Macular edema in the right eye also resolved after intravitreal antiangiogenic therapy.Conclusion:This is the first reported case of bilateral CRVO in a case of hemoglobin C trait. It is possible that erythrocyte inflexibility, caused by hemoglobin C-induced dehydration and crystallization, acted concomitantly with hypertension to produce occlusive microangiopathy. This case highlights the need for further investigation in patients presenting with central retinal vein occlusion, especially when bilateral, or when retinal angiography reveals bilateral pathology. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

13,A review on the role of miR-210 in human disorders,2023,Pathology Research and Practice,"MicroRNA-210 (miR-210) is a miRNA with imperative effects in the pathophysiology of human disorders. miR-210 is encoded by MIR210 gene on chromosome 11p15.5. The stem–loop of this miRNA resides in an intron of the AK123483 noncoding RNA. This miRNA is a major hypoxamir whose expression is increased in hypoxic condition in several types of cells. miR-210 has been shown to be up-regulated in almost all types of examined cancer types, except for bladder cancer, angiosarcoma and glioblastoma.

14,Correlation of Asymmetric Dimethyl Arginine Level to Sickle Retinopathy in Children with Sickle Cell Disease,2023,Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology,"Asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) is a competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthetase especially in L-arginine deficiency, which is the case in sickle cell disease (SCD). we aimed to assess the level of ADMA in children with sickle retinopathy and to correlate it to the degree of retinopathy. In this cross-sectional study 40 children with SCD were included, 20 of them with sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) (group I), 20 with normal fundus examination (group II), and another 20 healthy children served as controls (group III). We measured ADMA level by ELISA and performed fundus examination. Seventeen of the 20 children included in group I had Grade I retinopathy (85%), 2 children had Grade II retinopathy (10%), and 1 child had Grade III retinopathy (5%). ADMA was significantly higher in SCD than controls (P-value <0.001), and it was even higher in patients with SCR compared those without retinopathy (P-value <0.002), and there was positive linear correlation between ADMA and the grade of retinopathy. The type of retinopathy detect in the studied patients was the nonproliferative type. In conclusion, ADMA is elevated in children with SCD, and its level is even higher in those who develop SCR. © 2023 Authors.

15,Laser therapy for retinopathy in sickle cell disease,2022,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,"Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) includes a group of inherited haemoglobinopathies affecting multiple organs including the eyes. Some people with SCD develop ocular manifestations. Vision-threatening complications are mainly due to proliferative sickle retinopathy, which is characterised by proliferation of new blood vessels. Laser photocoagulation is widely applicable in proliferative retinopathies. It is important to evaluate the efficacy and safety of laser photocoagulation in the treatment of proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR) to prevent sight-threatening complications. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of various techniques of laser photocoagulation therapy in SCD-related proliferative retinopathy. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group’s Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 4 July 2022. We also searched the following resources (26 June 2022): Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature Database (LILACS); WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platforms (ICTRP); and ClinicalTrials.gov. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing laser photocoagulation to no treatment in children and adults with SCD. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and risk of bias of the included trials; we extracted and analysed data, contacting trial authors for additional information. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Main results: We included three trials (414 eyes of 339 children and adults) comparing the efficacy and safety of laser photocoagulation to no therapy in people with PSR. There were 160 males and 179 females ranging in age from 13 to 67 years. The trials used different laser photocoagulation techniques; one single-centre trial employed sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation using an argon laser; a two-centre trial employed feeder vessel coagulation using argon laser in one centre and xenon arc in the second centre; while a third trial employed focal scatter laser photocoagulation using argon laser. The mean follow-up periods were 21 to 32 months in one trial, 42 to 47 months in a second, and 48 months in the third. Two trials had a high risk of allocation bias due to the randomisation method for participants with bilateral disease; the third trial had an unclear risk of selection bias. One trial was at risk of reporting bias. Given the unit of analysis is the eye rather than the individual, we chose to report the data narratively. Using sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation, one trial (174 eyes) reported no difference between groups for complete regression of PSR: 30.2% in the laser group and 22.4% in the control group. The same trial also reported no difference between groups in the development of new PSR: 34.3% of lasered eyes and 41.3% of control eyes (very low-certainty evidence). The two-centre trial using feeder vessel coagulation, only presented data at follow-up for one centre (mean period of nine years) and reported the development of new sea fan in 48.0% in the treated and 45.0% in the control group; no statistical significance (P = 0.64). A third trial reported regression in 55% of the laser group versus 28.6% of controls and progression of PSR in 10.5% of treated versus 25.7% of control eyes. We graded the evidence for these two primary outcomes as very low-certainty evidence. The sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation trial reported visual loss in 3.0% of treated eyes (mean follow-up 47 months) versus 12.0% of controlled eyes (mean follow-up 42 months) (P = 0.019). The feeder vessel coagulation trial reported visual loss in 1.14% of the laser group and 7.5% of the control group (mean follow-up 26 months at one site and 32 months in another) (P = 0.07). The focal scatter laser photocoagulation trial (mean follow-up of four years) reported that 72/73 eyes had the same visual acuity, while visual loss was seen in only one eye from the control group. We graded the certainty of the evidence as very low. The sectoral scatter laser trial detected vitreous haemorrhage in 12.0% of the laser group and 25.3% of control with a mean follow-up of 42 (control) to 47 months (treated) (P ≤ 0.5). The two-centre feeder vessel coagulation trial observed vitreous haemorrhage in 3.4% treated eyes (mean follow-up 26 months) versus 27.5% control eyes (mean follow-up 32 months); one centre (mean follow-up nine years) reported vitreous haemorrhage in 1/25 eyes (4.0%) in the treatment group and 9/20 eyes (45.0%) in the control group (P = 0.002). The scatter laser photocoagulation trial reported that vitreous haemorrhage was not seen in the treated group compared to 6/35 (17.1%) eyes in the control group and appeared only in the grades B and (PSR) stage III) (P < 0.05). We graded evidence for this outcome as low-certainty. Regarding adverse effects, only one occurrence of retinal tear was reported. All three trials reported on retinal detachment, with no significance across the treatment and control groups (low-certainty evidence). One trial reported on choroidal neovascularization, with treatment with xenon arc found to be associated with a significantly higher risk, but visual loss related to this complication is uncommon with long-term follow-up of three years or more. The included trials did not report on other adverse effects or quality of life. Authors' conclusions: Our conclusions are based on the data from three trials (two of which were conducted over 30 years ago). Given the limited evidence available, which we assessed to be of low- or very low-certainty, we are uncertain whether laser therapy for sickle cell retinopathy improves the outcomes measured in this review. This treatment does not appear to have an effect on clinical outcomes such as regression of PSR and development of new incidences. No evidence is available assessing efficacy in relation to patient-important outcomes (such as quality of life or the loss of a driving licence). Further research is needed to examine the safety of laser treatment compared to other interventions such as intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). Patient-important outcomes as well as cost-effectiveness should be addressed. Copyright © 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration.

16,Attitude and Awareness of Bahraini Medical and Non-Medical Students Towards Premarital Screening,2022,Bahrain Medical Bulletin,"Background: The Kingdom of Bahrain was ranked among the 20 countries with the highest prevalence of inherited blood disorders. As a consequence, an obligatory law for premarital testing and counseling was passed by Bahrain`s Government to all couples who are planning to get married. Objectives: To assess the extent of Bahraini university students` awareness and understanding regarding the premarital testing, and to determine their tendency of compliance with the premarital test results, and finally to compare the level of conversance amongst medical and non-medical students for both genders. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Arabian Gulf University and Bahrain Teachers College. Methods and materials: This study was conducted in Bahrain from July to September 2019. Data were collected using online questionnaires which were sent via social media to 313 students from both universities. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 25. Results: About 313 students were included in this study, and the majority were practically aware that the test was mandatory and that the compliance to its results was optional. According to the survey, more than fifty percent of non-medical students responded positively and stated that they would comply with the test`s results if both partners were carriers of the same hereditary disease. However, 80 (51.6%) medical students might have gotten married against the counselor’s advice if they were under such a circumstance. Conclusion: The results showed that students’ major does not affect one’s Knowledge and compliance to premarital test results. © 2022, Bahrain Medical Bulletin.

Wiley, David Peprah, Kenneth Olumba, and Alisa T. Thavikulwat. Proliferative retinopathy associated with repeated high-Altitude exposure in a patient with sickle cell trait. High Alt Med Biol. 23:369-371, 2022.-Sickle cell trait (SCT), a carrier state characterized by one normal copy of the beta-globin gene (producing hemoglobin A) and one abnormal variant (producing hemoglobin S), is typically asymptomatic and very low risk for manifestations of hemoglobinopathy, including development of retinopathy. Reported cases of proliferative retinopathy in patients with SCT have occurred in the context of concurrent ocular or systemic disease. We report a case of an otherwise healthy patient with SCT who developed proliferative retinopathy requiring surgical intervention in the setting of significant exposure to high altitude through increased work hours as a flight attendant in the month leading to her presentation. Significant high-Altitude exposure may contribute to development of retinopathy in patients with sickle trait. Practitioners should consider the possibility of sickle cell retinopathy in patients with sickle trait in these circumstances. © Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.","['adult', '  altitude', '  Article', '  case report', '  clinical article', '  disease association', '  disease duration', '  eye examination', '  female', '  flight attendant', '  health care personnel', '  high myopia', '  human', '  intraoperative period', '  laser coagulation', '  laser refractive surgery', '  limb injury', '  medical history', '  middle aged', '  pars plana vitrectomy', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  retina detachment', '  retina fluorescein angiography', '  retina hemorrhage', '  retina neovascularization', '  retina surgery', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  sickle cell trait', '  visual disorder', '  vitreous floaters', '  vitreous hemorrhage', '  altitude', '  complication', '  eye', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell trait', '  Altitude', '  Eye', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Sickle Cell Trait']",0.0,Mary Ann Liebert Inc.,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Institutes of Health, NIH, Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, DDCF, Colgate-Palmolive Company, American Association for Dental, Craniofacial Research]",['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
18,Comparison of Retinal Imaging Techniques in Individuals with Pulmonary Artery Hypertension Using Vessel Generation Analysis,2022,Life,"(1) Background: Retinal vascular imaging plays an essential role in diagnosing and managing chronic diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, sickle cell retinopathy, and systemic hypertension. Previously, we have shown that individuals with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a rare disorder, exhibit unique retinal vascular changes as seen using fluorescein angiography (FA) and that these changes correlate with PAH severity. This study aimed to determine if color fundus (CF) imaging could garner identical retinal information as previously seen using FA images in individuals with PAH. (2) Methods: VESGEN, computer software which provides detailed vascular patterns, was used to compare manual segmentations of FA to CF imaging in PAH subjects (n = 9) followed by deep learning (DL) processing of CF imaging to increase the speed of analysis and facilitate a noninvasive clinical translation. (3) Results: When manual segmentation of FA and CF images were compared using VESGEN analysis, both showed identical tortuosity and vessel area density measures. This remained true even when separating images based on arterial trees only. However, this was not observed with microvessels. DL segmentation when compared to manual segmentation of CF images showed similarities in vascular structure as defined by fractal dimension. Similarities were lost for tortuosity and vessel area density when comparing manual CF imaging to DL imaging. (4) Conclusions: Noninvasive imaging such as CF can be used with VESGEN to provide an accurate and safe assessment of retinal vascular changes in individuals with PAH. In addition to providing insight into possible future clinical translational use. © 2022 by the authors.",,0.0,MDPI,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Institutes of Health, NIH, U.S. Department, Veterans Affairs]",['United States'],2014 - 2023,1

20,Risk factors associated with sickle cell retinopathy: findings from the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease,2022,International Journal of Retina and Vitreous,"Background: Sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) is one of the most important ocular manifestations of sickle cell disease (SCD). This study aims to assess the prevalence of SCR in SCD, identify risk factors for its development and progression to proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (PSCR), and evaluate the potential implications of these results on clinical practice. Methods: This research is a secondary analysis of patients diagnosed with SCD from the epidemiological, multicenter Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD). We included all patients who completed a full ophthalmic evaluation. We identified clinical and laboratory SCD characteristics associated with SCR using multivariate logistic regression models. Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (PSCR) was diagnosed according to the Goldberg classification system. Results: Of the 1904 study participants with SCD who met the inclusion criteria, 953 (50.1%) had retinopathy; of which 642 (67.3%) had bilateral disease. SCR was associated with older age (p < 0.001), history of smoking (p = 0.001), hematuria (p = 0.050), and a lower hemoglobin F (HbF) level (p < 0.001). PSCR risk increased with smoking (p = 0.005), older age (p < 0.001) higher hemoglobin level (p < 0.001) and higher white blood cell count (p = 0.011). Previous blood transfusion (p = 0.050), higher reticulocyte count (p = 0.019) and higher HbF level (p < 0.001) were protective factors against the development of PSCR. Ocular symptoms were associated with progression to PSCR in patients with SCR (p = 0.021). Conclusion: In this cohort of individuals with SCD, half of the participants had signs of SCR. Smoking and blood hemoglobin level were the two modifiable risk factors associated with increased retinopathy progression. Screening to identify the different stages of retinopathy, actively promoting smoking cessation, and optimizing the hematological profile of patients with SCD should guide treatment protocols designed to prevent the vision-threatening complications of the disease. © 2022, The Author(s).","['hemoglobin F', '  adolescent', '  adult', '  Article', '  blood transfusion', '  clinical practice', '  cohort analysis', '  controlled study', '  disease association', '  female', '  hematuria', '  hemoglobin blood level', '  human', '  leukocyte count', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  medical history', '  protection', '  reticulocyte count', '  retinopathy', '  risk factor', '  secondary analysis', '  sickle cell anemia', '  smoking', '  smoking cessation']",1.0,BioMed Central Ltd,English,Article,"['Jordan', ' Kuwait', ' Qatar', ' United States']",[],['Jordan'],2014 - 2023,4

22,Retinal atrophy and markers of systemic and cerebrovascular severity in homozygous sickle cell disease,2022,European Journal of Ophthalmology,"Introduction: While paramacular retinal atrophy (PRA) is known to be found in 48% of eyes of adults and 42% of eyes of children with homozygous SCD (SS-SCD), the aim of this study is to assess the association between PRA and red blood cell (RBC) deformability, hematological markers and brain imaging abnormalities in SS-SCD. Methods: This study is a subset of DREAM2, a prospective observational study performed between August 2015 and August 2016. Children (5–17 years) with SS-SCD and no history of large vessel vasculopathy, were included. Ophthalmological characteristics including visual acuity, fundus examination, OCT of central and temporal retina (with several retinal thickness measurements) were explored in relation with RBC deformability (ektacytometry), hematological and biochemical (hemolysis parameters), and neurological (cerebral oxygenation estimated by Near Infrared Spectroscopy, brain magnetic resonance imaging) investigations. Results: 17 children (5 boys; mean age: 13 years) with complete ophthalmological investigations were included in the analysis; 8 exhibited PRA. RBC deformability was found to be significantly lower in children with PRA for measurements made at 1.69 Pa (0.16 a.u ± 0.02 vs 0.21 a.u ± 0.03, p = 0.02) and above, as well as cerebral oxygenation (59.25% ± 9.9 vs 71.53% ± 4.9, p = 0.02). A significant positive correlation was found between temporal retinal thickness and hemoglobin level (ρ = 0.65, p = 0.007), hematocrit (ρ = 0.53, p = 0.04) and RBC deformability at 3 Pa (ρ = 0.75, p = 0.005) and above. Conclusions: These results suggest that PRA could be an early marker of systemic severity and cerebral oxygenation in SCD. Whether it could help predicting cerebral vasculopathy requires further investigations. © The Author(s) 2022.","['alanine aminotransferase', '  aspartate aminotransferase', '  bilirubin', '  hemoglobin', '  lactate dehydrogenase', '  hemoglobin', '  adolescent', '  Article', '  atrophy', '  blood flow velocity', '  blood transfusion', '  brain analysis', '  cerebrospinal fluid analysis', '  child', '  clinical article', '  computer assisted tomography', '  controlled study', '  Doppler flowmetry', '  erythrocyte count', '  erythrocyte deformability', '  female', '  flow cytometry', '  flow kinetics', '  genetic association', '  hemoglobin blood level', '  human', '  male', '  mean corpuscular volume', '  near infrared spectroscopy', '  nuclear magnetic resonance imaging', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  optical coherence tomography', '  oxygen saturation', '  oxygenation', '  preschool child', '  prospective study', '  retinal nerve fiber layer thickness', '  retinal thickness', '  school child', '  shear stress', '  shear wave elastography', '  sickle cell anemia', '  tissue oxygenation', '  visual acuity', '  visual field', '  visual stimulation', '  vitreous body', '  white matter', '  adult', '  atrophy', '  complication', '  pathology', '  procedures', '  retina', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Atrophy', '  Child', '  Hemoglobins', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Retina', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence']",0.0,SAGE Publications Ltd,English,Article,['France'],[Fondation],['France'],2014 - 2023,1
23,Investigation of thrombin generation assay to predict vaso-occlusive crisis in adulthood with sickle cell disease,2022,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy disorder. The main consequence is synthesis of hemoglobin S leading to chronic hemolysis associated with morbidity. The aim of this study was to investigate Thrombin Generation Assay (TGA) to assess hypercoagulability in SCD and TGA parameters as biomarkers of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) risk and hospitalization within 1 year. Materials and methods: We performed TGA in platelet poor plasma (PPP) with 1 pM of tissue factor and 4 μM of phospholipid-standardized concentration, in duplicate for patients and controls. We measured thrombomodulin (TM), soluble endothelial Protein C Receptor and Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI). Results: A total of 113 adult patients with SCD, 83 at steady state and 30 during VOC, and 25 healthy controls matched on age and gender were included. Among the 83 patients at steady state, (36 S/S-1 S/β0, 20 S/Sα3.7, and 19 S/C-7 S/β+) 28 developed a VOC within 1 year (median: 4 months [2.25–6]). We observed an increase of peak and velocity associated with a shortening of lagtime and time to peak (TTP) and no difference of endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) in patients compared to controls. TFPI (p &lt; 0.001) and TM (p = 0.006) were significantly decreased. TGA confirmed hypercoagulability in all SCD genotypes and clinical status. The association of ETP &gt; 1,207 nM.min and peak &gt;228.5 nM presented a sensitivity of 73.5% and a specificity of 93.9% to predict VOC development within 1 year. Conclusion: We have demonstrated a hypercoagulable state in SCD associated with chronic hemolysis. These preliminary findings suggest that TGA parameters, as ETP and peak, could be used to predict VOC development within 1 year.

24,Sex as an Independent Risk Factor for Venous Thromboembolism in Sickle Cell Disease: A Cross-Sectional Study,2022,Journal of Women's Health,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) affects up to 25% of individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD), but risk factors are not well characterized. We sought to measure the prevalence of VTE among SCD patients in our health system and to describe the relationship between medical history, biological sex, and VTE. We performed a retrospective chart review of SCD patients who visited an outpatient hematology clinic within Penn Medicine between June 2014 and June 2019. Demographics and medical history were compared across those with and without a history of VTE. We developed a logistic regression model to describe factors independently associated with VTE. Of 597 patients with SCD who were identified, 147 (24.6%) had a history of VTE; 100 were female and 47 were male. In the regression model, female sex was independently associated with history of VTE (odds ratio 1.91, 95% confidence interval 1.26-2.91), as were pulmonary hypertension, hydroxyurea use, and history of stroke. Among females only, 49.7% were parous and 18.8% had used oral contraceptives, and these proportions did not differ by history of VTE. One-quarter of the SCD patients in our health system had a history of VTE, confirming significantly higher rates than in the general population. Females had twice the odds of VTE compared to males, highlighting an important sex disparity in SCD disease outcomes and raising questions regarding optimal pregnancy and contraceptive care for females with SCD. © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","['estrogen', '  hydroxyurea', '  oral contraceptive agent', '  acute chest syndrome', '  adult', '  Article', '  avascular necrosis', '  cerebrovascular accident', '  contraception', '  controlled study', '  cross-sectional study', '  deep vein thrombosis', '  demographics', '  end stage renal disease', '  female', '  genotype', '  human', '  leg ulcer', '  lifetime prevalence', '  lung embolism', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  medical history', '  medical record review', '  obesity', '  pathophysiology', '  pregnancy', '  priapism', '  pulmonary hypertension', '  retinopathy', '  retrospective study', '  risk factor', '  sex factor', '  sickle cell anemia', '  smoking', '  thrombophilia', '  venous thromboembolism', '  complication', '  risk factor', '  sickle cell anemia', '  venous thromboembolism', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Cross-Sectional Studies', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Pregnancy', '  Retrospective Studies', '  Risk Factors', '  Venous Thromboembolism']",0.0,Mary Ann Liebert Inc.,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
25,The Angiotensin AT2 Receptor: Froma Binding Site to a Novel Therapeutic Target,2022,Pharmacological Reviews,"Discovered more than 30 years ago, the angiotensin AT2 receptor (AT2R) has evolved from a binding site with unknown function to a firmly established major effector within the protective arm of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and a target for new drugs in development. The AT2R represents an endogenous protective mechanism that can be manipulated in the majority of preclinical models to alleviate lung, renal, cardiovascular, metabolic, cutaneous, and neural diseases as well as cancer. This article is a comprehensive review summarizing our current knowledge of the AT2R, from its discovery to its position within the RAS and its overall functions. This is followed by an in-depth look at the characteristics of the AT2R, including its structure, intracellular signaling, homo- and heterodimerization, and expression. AT2R-selective ligands, from endogenous peptides to synthetic peptides and nonpeptide molecules that are used as research tools, are discussed. Finally, we summarize the known physiological roles of the AT2R and its abundant protective effects in multiple experimental disease models and expound on AT2R ligands that are undergoing development for clinical use. The present review highlights the controversial aspects and gaps in our knowledge of this receptor and illuminates future perspectives for AT2 R research. © 2022 by The American Society for

Since the 1970s, the life expectancy of those affected has risen significantly, and about 95 % now live to adulthood. Therefore, general practitioners and internists should be familiar with the different forms of sickle cell disease, especially HbSC disease (approx. 20 %). A precise diagnosis of sickle cell disease (exact phenotype) is essential; the term sickle cell anaemia must be avoided. In patients of African origin with microcytosis, slightly elevated reticulocytes and pain symptomatology, the possibility of HbSC disease should be considered - even with age-appropriate haemoglobin values. Annual retinoscopy is recommended for HbSC patients from the age of 7, and for all other sickle cell patients from the age of 10. If a hearing loss occurs in an HbSC patient, phlebotomy should be performed immediately. In all sickle cell patients with dizziness or pain and an Hb > 10g/dl, phlebotomy is indicated. © 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag.

29,Validity of smartphone-based retinal photography (PEEK-retina) compared to the standard ophthalmic fundus camera in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy in Uganda: A cross-sectional study,2022,PLoS ONE,"Introduction Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the major complications of diabetes mellitus and is a significant cause of blindness worldwide. In Uganda, the prevalence of diabetes is approximately 2.7% of the urban population and 1% in rural areas. Many diabetics cannot access an eye exam due to the lack of less costly and user-friendly equipment that primary eye workers can use. Smartphone-based fundus photography allows for a cheap and mobile fundus examination. The study aimed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Portable Eye Examination Kit (PEEK) retina compared to a standard ophthalmic fundus camera (Zeiss Visucam 200) for the diagnosis of DR. Methods From January-March 2020, 286 people with diabetes (type 1 & 2) patients were seen at Kiruddu National referral hospital diabetes clinic. All participants had funduscopy with PEEK retina and the standard ophthalmic fundus camera following ophthalmic examination and pupillary dilation. The PEEK retina’s sensitivity, specificity and reliability were determined using an ophthalmic fundus camera as the gold standard. Results The participants’ mean age was 51 with a standard deviation of ±11years, 213 (74.5%) were females, and the majority (93.4%) had Type 2 diabetes. The overall Sensitivity of PEEK retina for DR was 84% (95% CI 70.9–83.5), while the specificity was 79.9% (95% CI 76–83.5) with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 30.9% (95% CI 23.2–39.4) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 97.9% (95% CI 95.9–99.1). Conclusions PEEK retina has high sensitivity and specificity, making it suitable for screening and diagnostic purposes. Therefore, we recommend the integration of the PEEK retina in the screening and diagnosis of DR in resource-limited settings. © 2022 Public Library of Science.

32,Deep learning-enabled ultra-widefield retinal vessel segmentation with an automated quality-optimized angiographic phase selection tool,2022,Eye (Basingstoke),"Objectives: To demonstrate the feasibility of a deep learning-based vascular segmentation tool for UWFA and evaluate its ability to automatically identify quality-optimized phase-specific images. Methods: Cumulative retinal vessel areas (RVA) were extracted from all available UWFA frames. Cubic splines were fitted for serial vascular assessment throughout the angiographic phases of eyes with diabetic retinopathy (DR), sickle cell retinopathy (SCR), or normal retinal vasculature. The image with maximum RVA was selected as the optimum early phase. A late phase frame was selected at a minimum of 4 min that most closely mirrored the RVA from the selected early image. Trained image analysts evaluated the selected pairs. Results: A total of 13,980 UWFA sequences from 462 sessions were used to evaluate the performance and 1578 UWFA sequences from 66 sessions were used to create cubic splines. Maximum RVA was detected at a mean of 41 ± 15, 47 ± 27, 38 ± 8 s for DR, SCR, and normals respectively. In 85.2% of the sessions, appropriate images for both phases were successfully identified. The individual success rate was 90.7% for early and 94.6% for late frames. Conclusions: Retinal vascular characteristics are highly phased and field-of-view sensitive. Vascular parameters extracted by deep learning algorithms can be used for quality assessment of angiographic images and quality optimized phase selection. Clinical applications of a deep learning-based vascular segmentation and phase selection system might significantly improve the speed, consistency, and objectivity of UWFA evaluation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.","['algorithm', '  Article', '  automation', '  deep learning', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  feature extraction', '  human', '  image analysis', '  image quality', '  image segmentation', '  imaging algorithm', '  measurement', '  retina angiography', '  retina blood vessel', '  retinopathy', '  retrospective study', '  sickle cell anemia', '  ultra widefield retinal vessel segmentation', '  vascularization', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  diagnostic imaging', '  fluorescence angiography', '  procedures', '  retina blood vessel', '  retina disease', '  Deep Learning', '  Diabetic Retinopathy', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Humans', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retinal Vessels']",3.0,Springer Nature,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Eye Institute, Gilead Sciences]",['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
33,Sickle Cell Trait and Risk for Common Diseases: Evidence from the UK Biobank,2022,American Journal of Medicine,"Background: Sickle cell trait is typically considered benign. Although evidence remains inconsistent, recent studies suggest that it is associated with several common diseases. We systematically assessed associations of sickle cell trait with reported diseases in a large population-based cohort. Methods: Study subjects were self-reported Blacks from the UK Biobank (UKB), a United Kingdom population-based cohort of subjects aged 40-69 years at recruitment in the United Kingdom. Sickle cell status was based on the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) or mutations in the HBB gene. Diagnoses of diseases were obtained from ICD-10 and self-reports. Associations of sickle cell trait and diseases were tested using logistic regression, adjusting for age at recruitment, sex, and genetic background (top 10 principal components). Results: Among the 8019 Blacks in the UKB, 699 (8.72%) were sickle cell trait carriers; the rate was significantly higher in females (9.74%) than males (7.48%), P = .0005. Sickle cell trait was under-diagnosed; most heterozygous hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB) gene Glu6Val carriers did not have a sickle cell trait ICD-10 record. Compared with non-sickle cell trait, sickle cell trait carriers had significantly increased risk for type 2 diabetes; odds ratio 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.68; P = .002. Sickle cell trait was also significantly associated with increased risk for renal diseases (rhabdomyolysis, end-stage renal disease, chronic kidney disease, renal papillary necrosis) and vascular diseases (hypertension, retinopathy, non-ischemic stroke), P < .05. While most of these diseases are complications/comorbidities of diabetes, their associations with sickle cell trait remained significant after adjusting for diabetes. Association with end-stage renal disease was stronger in subjects without diabetes, odds ratio 6.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.93-19.61; P = .001. Conclusions: Sickle cell trait is significantly associated with increased risk for diabetes and diabetes-related complications/comorbidities. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","['glutamic acid', '  hemoglobin beta chain', '  insulin', '  oral antidiabetic agent', '  valine', '  adult', '  age', '  aged', '  Article', '  biobank', '  Black person', '  cerebrovascular accident', '  chronic kidney failure', '  cohort analysis', '  comorbidity', '  controlled study', '  disease association', '  disease carrier', '  end stage renal disease', '  female', '  gene mutation', '  genetic association', '  genetic background', '  HBB gene', '  heterozygote', '  human', '  hypertension', '  ICD-10', '  kidney papilla necrosis', '  logistic regression analysis', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  middle aged', '  non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus', '  population research', '  retinopathy', '  rhabdomyolysis', '  risk assessment', '  self report', '  sex', '  sickle cell trait', '  underdiagnosis', '  United Kingdom', '  biobank', '  chronic kidney failure', '  complication', '  genetics', '  non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus', '  sickle cell trait', '  Biological Specimen Banks', '  Diabetes Mellitus', ' Type 2', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Kidney Failure', ' Chronic', '  Male', '  Sickle Cell Trait', '  United Kingdom']",1.0,Elsevier Inc.,English,Article,['United States'],[NorthShore University HealthSystem],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1

35,Sickle Cell Disease: A Review,2022,JAMA,"Importance: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder of hemoglobin, characterized by formation of long chains of hemoglobin when deoxygenated within capillary beds, resulting in sickle-shaped red blood cells, progressive multiorgan damage, and increased mortality. An estimated 300000 infants are born annually worldwide with SCD. Most individuals with SCD live in sub-Saharan Africa, India, the Mediterranean, and Middle East; approximately 100000 individuals with SCD live in the US. Observations: SCD is diagnosed through newborn screening programs, where available, or when patients present with unexplained severe atraumatic pain or normocytic anemia. In SCD, sickling and hemolysis of red blood cells result in vaso-occlusion with associated ischemia. SCD is characterized by repeated episodes of severe acute pain and acute chest syndrome, and by other complications including stroke, chronic pain, nephropathy, retinopathy, avascular necrosis, priapism, and leg ulcers. In the US, nearly all children with SCD survive to adulthood, but average life expectancy remains 20 years less than the general population, with higher mortality as individuals transition from pediatric to adult-focused health care systems. Until 2017, hydroxyurea, which increases fetal hemoglobin and reduces red blood cell sickling, was the only disease-modifying therapy available for SCD and remains first-line therapy for most individuals with SCD. Three additional therapies, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor, have been approved as adjunctive or second-line agents. In clinical trials, L-glutamine reduced hospitalization rates by 33% and mean length of stay from 11 to 7 days compared with placebo. Crizanlizumab reduced pain crises from 2.98 to 1.63 per year compared with placebo. Voxelotor increased hemoglobin by at least 1 g/dL, significantly more than placebo (51% vs 7%). Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative therapy, but it is limited by donor availability, with best results seen in children with a matched sibling donor. While SCD is characterized by acute and chronic pain, patients are not more likely to develop addiction to pain medications than the general population. Conclusions and Relevance: In the US, approximately 100000 people have SCD, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, acute and chronic pain, acute chest syndrome; increased incidence of stroke, nephropathy, and retinopathy; and a life span that is 20 years shorter than the general population. While hydroxyurea is first-line therapy for SCD, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor have been approved in the US since 2017 as adjunctive or second-line treatments, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant with a matched sibling donor is now standard care for severe disease. © 2022 American Medical Association.

Parte II: manifestaciones renales, neurológicas y sensoriales]",2022,"Revista Cubana de Hematologia, Inmunologia y Hemoterapia","Introduction: The increase in life expectancy of patients with sickle cell disease causes co-morbidities and chronic organ dysfunction to be added to the clinical manifestations of the disease. Objectives: To analyze the renal, neurological and sensory alterations that appear in patients with sickle cell disease as manifestations of chronic organic dysfunction. Methods: A review of the articles published in the last ten years was carried out using the search engines PubMed, SciELO and Google Scholar. The search terms were: sickle cell disease, organ dysfunction, mortality, proteinuria, chronic kidney disease, silent cerebral infarction, neurocognitive disorders, retinopathy, sensorineural deafness Analysis and synthesis of information: The combined effect of glomerular, tubular and interstitial involvement leads to a gradual decline in kidney function. Progression to end-stage chronic kidney disease is common and is associated with increased mortality. Central nervous system complications can also have a negative impact on survival or cause sequelae that influence the quality of life of patients.

37,MACULAR INFARCTION in A PATIENT with SICKLE CELL TRAIT,2022,Retinal Cases and Brief Reports,"Purpose: Sickle cell trait affects 8% of African Americans. Once believed to represent a benign carrier state, it has been linked to an increased risk of several of the pathological conditions that arise in sickle cell disease in at-risk individuals with hematologic and vascular comorbidities. Macular infarction is a known complication of sickle cell disease; this article illustrates this unique presentation in a patient with sickle cell trait.Methods:Case report.Patient:A 74-year-old African American man presented with the complaint of a central scotoma of the right eye.Results:Multimodal retinal imaging identified central macular infarction with severe inner retinal atrophy. Laboratory testing confirmed the presence of sickle cell trait. Other pertinent positives included low levels of protein C and protein S, untreated obstructive sleep apnea, and elevated levels of homocysteine in the setting of alcoholic liver cirrhosis and chronic kidney disease.Conclusion:Ocular manifestations of sickle cell trait have most frequently been reported in individuals with systemic medical comorbidities that predispose to erythrocyte sickling and vaso-occlusive disease.

38,"Incidence of eye complications among sickle cell disease patients in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia: A cross-sectional study",2022,Annals of Medicine and Surgery,"Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a heritable blood disorder resulting in deformed, rigid red blood cells, rendering them more prone to vaso-occlusion. Ocular complications are known to affect multiple organs through the body's vasculature. Here, we evaluated the incidence of eye complications in patients with SCD at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Materials and methods: We used a cross-sectional approach and collected relevant medical data from nine patients with SCD. Ophthalmic assessment included visual acuity and an in-clinic dilated fundus examination. All patients were asked to attend the ophthalmology clinic to undergo optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography, macular OCT scan, and fundus photography. The results of the imaging tests were interpreted by a certified ophthalmology consultant specializing in retinal diseases. Descriptive analyses of the results were also performed. Results: The mean age of the nine patients was 24.78 ± 10.9 years. All patients were non-hypertensive, one had type 1 diabetes, and another had type 2 diabetes. Five patients had normal visual acuity, two had slight impairments in at least one eye, and two had moderate impairment in at least one eye. One of the nine patients exhibited retinal ischemia in the right eye despite normal macular thickness (visual acuity, OD, 6/30; OS, 6/21). The remaining eight patients showed no ocular abnormalities. Conclusion: Of the nine patients with SCD, five showed no symptoms of ocular complications. One patient showed retinal ischemia in the right eye, despite a normal macular thickness. This study's results suggest routine ophthalmologic examination may not be able to detect or monitor macular or retinal abnormalities unless augmented with detailed imaging techniques. © 2022","['eye drops', '  adult', '  Article', '  clinical article', '  consultation', '  cross-sectional study', '  descriptive research', '  eye examination', '  female', '  human', '  incidence', '  insulin dependent diabetes mellitus', '  male', '  non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus', '  optical coherence tomography angiography', '  retina disease', '  retinopathy', '  Saudi Arabia', '  sickle cell anemia', '  visual acuity']",1.0,Elsevier Ltd,English,Article,['Saudi Arabia'],[],['Saudi Arabia'],2014 - 2023,1

Observations: OCTA imaging of the macula in two patients with HbSS and HbSC revealed areas of decreased vascular density, more prominent in the deep capillary plexus than in the superficial capillary plexus. Conjunctival OCTA of both affected patients revealed areas of reduced vascular density corresponding to the vascular abnormalities observed on slit lamp examination and prominent conjunctival flow voids when compared to an unaffected control. Conclusionsand Importance: OCTA allows for high resolution visualization of conjunctival findings present in sickle cell patients with macular vascular flow voids. Further studies are needed to explore the utility of conjunctival OCTA and the relationship between conjunctival and macular perfusion and systemic hemoglobinopathy. © 2022","['bevacizumab', '  hemoglobin S', '  hydroxyurea', '  adult', '  Article', '  blood flow', '  blood vessel density', '  bulbar conjunctiva', '  capillary', '  case report', '  clinical article', '  controlled study', '  epiretinal membrane', '  female', '  hemoglobinopathy', '  human', '  light', '  male', '  medical history', '  neovascularization (pathology)', '  optical coherence tomography angiography', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  retina fovea', '  retina macula lutea', '  retina maculopathy', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  slit lamp microscopy', '  visual acuity', '  vitreous hemorrhage']",0.0,Elsevier Inc.,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1

With the optimization of tabletop systems and the development of experimental handheld OCTA devices, there is expanded potential for OCTA in the clinic and the operating room. This article reviews the utility of OCTA in some of the most common pediatric retinal disorders. Methods: A thorough computerized PubMed search was performed to review relevant published journal articles to contextualize and identify the role of OCTA in common retinal disorders with vascular involvement affecting children. Pertinent results and findings from original investigations and case reports were summarized. Results: The ability to quickly collect both qualitative and quantitative information about retinal microvasculature, in both the clinic and operating room settings, with OCTA, has led to the uncovering of microvascular features and morphologic changes in many pediatric retinal disorders such as Coats Disease, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, incontinentia pigmenti, sickle cell retinopathy, Stargardt Disease, X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy in type 1 diabetes, pediatric retinal tumors, and choroidal neovascularization.

44,Nonmydriatic Ultra-Widefield Fundus Photography in a Hematology Clinic Shows Utility for Screening of Sickle Cell Retinopathy,2022,American Journal of Ophthalmology,"PURPOSE: To determine the feasibility and accuracy of nonmydriatic ultra-widefield (UWF) fundus photographs taken in a hematology clinic setting for screening of sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: This single-site study took place at the Johns Hopkins Sickle Cell Center for Adults and the Wilmer Eye Institute. The study population was 90 eyes of 46 consecutive adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). Bilateral nonmydriatic fundus photos taken by clinic personnel during the participants’ routine hematology appointment were graded by 2 masked retina specialists at the Wilmer Eye Institute for the presence of nonproliferative SCR (NPSR) and proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR). A third retina specialist adjudicated in cases of grader disagreement. All participants underwent the standard dilated fundus examination (DFE) within 2 years of acquisition of UWF photographs. The main outcome measure was the sensitivity and specificity of nonmydriatic UWF images for the detection of NPSR and PSR RESULTS: PSR was noted in 19 of 90 eyes that underwent DFE and in 9 of 67 gradable UWF images. Interrater agreement between the 2 graders was moderate, with κ = 0.65 (range 0.43-0.87) for PSR. For gradable UWF photos, the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SCR using the nonmydriatic photos compared with the DFE were 85.2% and 62.5% for NPSR, respectively, and 69.2% and 100% for detection of PSR, respectively. One participant required ophthalmic therapy in both eyes for active sea-fan neovascularization. CONCLUSIONS: UWF imaging shows utility in screening for SCR and may help identify patients with PSR who require a DFE and who may benefit from treatment. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","['crizanlizumab', '  hydroxyurea', '  voxelotor', '  adult', '  aged', '  Article', '  best corrected visual acuity', '  clinical article', '  cohort analysis', '  diagnostic accuracy', '  diagnostic test accuracy study', '  diagnostic value', '  eye examination', '  eye fundus', '  eye photography', '  feasibility study', '  female', '  human', '  intermethod comparison', '  male', '  proof of concept', '  prospective study', '  retina neovascularization', '  retinopathy', '  sensitivity and specificity', '  sickle cell anemia', '  visual impairment', '  complication', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  eye fundus', '  hematology', '  photography', '  procedures', '  retina disease', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Diabetic Retinopathy', '  Fundus Oculi', '  Hematology', '  Humans', '  Photography', '  Prospective Studies', '  Retinal Diseases']",1.0,Elsevier Inc.,English,Article,['United States'],"[Pfizer, Genentech, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, NPC, VitreoRetinal Surgery Foundation, EY01765]",['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
45,Salmon patch-associated vitreous hemorrhage in non-proliferative sickle cell retinopathy masquerading as infectious uveitis,2022,American Journal of Ophthalmology Case Reports,"Purpose: To report three cases of non-proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (NPSR) with vitreous hemorrhage masquerading as infectious uveitis. Observations: Three patients were referred from ophthalmologists to our practices with clinical findings suggestive of infectious uveitis. The first patient was referred for new-onset floaters in both eyes, bilateral vitritis and dome-shaped lesions on B-scan ultrasound. He was initially treated for tuberculosis uveitis due to a positive purified protein derivative test. The second patient was referred with floaters and hazy vision in the setting of recent fever and headache and was also reported to have vitritis and unilateral yellow vitreoretinal lesions on fundoscopy. She was initially treated for toxoplasmosis and endogenous endophthalmitis. The third patient presented with flashes, floaters, and decreased vision four months after a ring-enhancing lesion was found on brain imaging, and was found to have unilateral vitritis with yellow vitreoretinal lesions. He was initially started on topical steroids and cycloplegics empirically for uveitis. All patients were ultimately diagnosed as having manifestations of NPSR, including vitreous hemorrhage, and dehemoglobinized salmon patch hemorrhages. Conclusions and Importance: NPSR can occasionally masquerade as infectious uveitis. Obtaining a detailed history with relevant ancillary testing, along with performing a careful physical exam to recognize important clues, can help the physician arrive at the correct diagnosis in these equivocal cases. © 2022","['clindamycin', '  cotrimoxazole', '  cycloplegic agent', '  cyproheptadine', '  difluprednate', '  fluconazole', '  folic acid', '  hemoglobin', '  hydroxyurea', '  isoniazid', '  paracetamol', '  pyrazinamide', '  rifampicin', '  steroid', '  adolescent', '  afferent pupillary defect', '  Article', '  B scan', '  best corrected visual acuity', '  candidiasis', '  case report', '  clinical article', '  conjunctival hemorrhage', '  endophthalmitis', '  erythrocyte sedimentation rate', '  eye injury', '  female', '  fever', '  fluorescence angiography', '  flushing', '  headache', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  hemolytic anemia', '  human', '  intraocular pressure', '  male', '  neuroimaging', '  nuclear magnetic resonance imaging', '  ocular toxoplasmosis', '  ocular tuberculosis', '  ophthalmologist', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  optical coherence tomography', '  pars plana vitrectomy', '  photosensitivity', '  retinopathy', '  seizure', '  sickle cell anemia', '  steroid therapy', '  topical treatment', '  tuberculin test', '  uveitis', '  visual disorder', '  vitreous floaters', '  vitreous hemorrhage', '  vitritis']",0.0,Elsevier Inc.,English,Article,['United States'],[RPB],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
46,Role of Circulating Microparticles in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Implications for Pathological Clotting,2022,Seminars in Thrombosis and Hemostasis,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a multifactorial chronic metabolic disease characterized by chronic hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance and a deficiency in insulin secretion. The global diabetes pandemic relates primarily to T2DM, which is the most prevalent form of diabetes, accounting for over 90% of all cases. Chronic low-grade inflammation, triggered by numerous risk factors, and the chronic activation of the immune system are prominent features of T2DM. Here we highlight the role of blood cells (platelets, and red and white blood cells) and vascular endothelial cells as drivers of systemic inflammation in T2DM. In addition, we discuss the role of microparticles (MPs) in systemic inflammation and hypercoagulation. Although once seen as inert by-products of cell activation or destruction, MPs are now considered to be a disseminated storage pool of bioactive effectors of thrombosis, inflammation, and vascular function. They have been identified to circulate at elevated levels in the bloodstream of individuals with increased risk of atherothrombosis or cardiovascular disease, two significant hallmark conditions of T2DM. There is also general evidence that MPs activate blood cells, express proinflammatory and coagulant effects, interact directly with cell receptors, and transfer biological material. MPs are considered major players in the pathogenesis of many systemic inflammatory diseases and may be potentially useful biomarkers of disease activity and may not only be of prognostic value but may act as novel therapeutic targets. © 2021 Thieme.

48,Unusually High Prevalence of Stroke and Cerebral Vasculopathy in Hemoglobin SC Disease: A Retrospective Single Institution Study,2022,Acta Haematologica,"Introduction: Unlike homozygous hemoglobin SS (HbSS) disease, stroke is a rare complication in hemoglobin SC (HbSC) disease. However, recent studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of silent stroke in HbSC disease. The factors associated with stroke and cerebral vasculopathy in the HbSC population are unknown. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of all patients with sickle cell disease treated at the University of Missouri, Columbia, over an 18-year period (2000-2018). The goal of the study was to characterize the silent, overt stroke, and cerebral vasculopathy in HbSC patients and compare them to patients with HbSS and HbS/β thalassemia1 (thal) in this cohort. We also analyzed the laboratory and clinical factors associated with stroke and cerebral vasculopathy in the HbSC population. Results: Of the 34 HbSC individuals, we found that the overall prevalence of stroke and cerebral vasculopathy was 17.7%. Only females had evidence of stroke or cerebral vasculopathy in our HbSC cohort (33.3%, p = 0.019). Time-averaged means of maximum velocities were lower in the HbSC group than the HbSS group and did not correlate with stroke outcome. Among HbSC individuals, those with stroke and cerebral vasculopathy had a marginally higher serum creatinine than those without these complications (0.77 mg/dL vs. 0.88 mg/dL, p = 0.08). Stroke outcome was associated with recurrent vaso-occlusive pain crises (Rec VOCs) (75 vs. 25%, p = 0.003) in HbSC patients. The predominant cerebrovascular lesions in HbSC included microhemorrhages and leukoencephalopathy. Conclusion: There is a distinct subset of individuals with HbSC who developed overt, silent stroke, and cerebral vasculopathy. A female predominance and association with Rec VOCs were identified in our cohort; however, larger clinical trials are needed to identify and confirm specific clinical and laboratory markers associated with stroke and vasculopathy in HbSC disease. © 2022 S.

The images were used to train a multilayer deep convolutional neural network to differentiate on UWF-CFP between different vascular diseases and healthy controls. A total of 224 UWF-CFP images were included, of which 169 images were of retinal vascular diseases and 55 were healthy controls. A cross-validation technique was used to ensure that every image from the dataset was tested once. Established augmentation techniques were applied to enhance performances, along with an Adam optimiser for training. The visualisation method was integrated gradient visualisation.ResultsThe best performance of the model was obtained using 10 epochs, with an overall accuracy of 88.4%. For DR, the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) was 90.5% and the accuracy was 85.2%. For RVO, the AUC was 91.2% and the accuracy 88.4%. For SCR, the AUC was 96.7% and the accuracy 93.8%. For healthy controls, the ROC was 88.5% with an accuracy that reached 86.2%.ConclusionDeep learning algorithms can classify several retinal vascular diseases on UWF-CPF with good accuracy.

50,Comparison of Ultra-Wide Field Photography to Ultra-Wide Field Angiography for the Staging of Sickle Cell Retinopathy,2022,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) is classified by Goldberg based on peripheral vascular changes. Ultra-wide field (UWF) imaging has enhanced visualization of the peripheral retina. However, there is no consensus on the optimal imaging technique for the screening of SCR. We performed a monocentric observational cross-sectional study to compare UWF fundus photography (UWF-FP) with UWF angiography (UWF-FA). All patients who underwent UWF-imaging (Optos, PLC, Scotland, UK) for screening of sickle cell retinopathy between January 2016 and December 2019 were retrospectively included. Eyes with previous laser treatment or concomitant retinal disease were excluded. UWF-FP images were graded based on the Goldberg classification by four graders with various degrees of experience. UWF-FA pictures were reviewed by an independent retina specialist. Differences in Goldberg staging across UWF-FP and UWF-FA were assessed. A total of 84 eyes of 44 patients were included. Based on UWF-FA, most eyes were stage 2 (77.4%) and 19 were stage 3 (22.6%). The pre-retinal neovascularization detection sensitivity on UWF-FP was 52.6 to 78.9%, depending on the graders. UWF-FA led to a later Goldberg stage of retinopathy, in most cases from stage 1 to stage 2. Neovascularization (stage 3) was not detected by our graders on UWF-FP in 21.1 to 57.9% of eyes. UWP-FP tends to underestimate Goldberg stages of retinopathy compared with UWF-FA and is less accurate when detecting neovascularization in sickle cell retinopathy, which has a direct impact on therapeutic management and prognosis. © 2022 by the authors.

51,Longitudinal assessment of quantitative ultra-widefield ischaemic and vascular parameters in sickle cell retinopathy,2022,British Journal of Ophthalmology,"Purpose To evaluate longitudinal quantitative ischaemic and vasculature parameters, including ischaemic index, vessel area, length and geodesic distance in sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) on ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWFA). Methods Optimal UWFA images from two longitudinal timepoints of 74 eyes from 45 patients with SCR were aligned and a common region of interest was determined. A deep-learning augmented ischaemia and vascular segmentation platform was used for feature extraction. Geodesic distance maps demonstrating the shortest distance within the vascular masks from the centre of the optic disc were created. Ischaemic index, vessel area, vessel length and geodesic distance were measured. Paired t-test and linear mixed effect model analysis were performed. Results Overall, 25 (44 eyes) patients with HbSS, 14 (19 eyes) with HbSC, 6 (11 eyes) with HbSthal and other genotypes were included. Mean age was 40.1±11.0 years. Mean time interval between two UWFA studies was 23.0±15.1 months (range: 3-71.3). Mean panretinal ischaemic index increased from 10.0±7.2% to 10.9±7.3% (p<0.005). Mean rate of change in ischaemic index was 0.5±0.7% per year. Mean vessel area (p=0.020) and geodesic distance (p=0.048) decreased significantly. Multivariate analysis demonstrated baseline ischaemic index and Goldberg stage are correlated with progression. Conclusion Longitudinal ischaemic index and retinal vascular parameter measurements demonstrate statistically significant progression in SCR. The clinical significance of these relatively small magnitude changes remains unclear but may provide insights into the progression of retinal ischaemia in SCR. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

53,Sickle Cell Retinopathy,2022,Albert and Jakobiec's Principles and Practice of Ophthalmology: Fourth Edition,"Sickle cell retinopathy prevalence increases with age and occurs earlier in patients with hemoglobin SC than with hemoglobin SS or SThalassemia subtypes. Sickle cell retinopathy is also more severe in patients with hemoglobin SC than hemoglobin SS or SThal. Screening should be performed as early as age 8 years old. Non-proliferative manifestations include optic disc, retinal vascular (tortuosity, hemorrhage, vascular occlusion), pigmentary (sunburst lesions), and retinal changes (iridescent spots, foveal depression sign). Proliferative disease is classified into five stages (arteriolar occlusion, arteriovenous anastomoses, neovascularization, vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal detachment). Untreated retinal neovascularization in sickle cell retinopathy may result in significant loss of vision. This chapter presents a detailed review of the epidemiology of sickle cell retinopathy, clinical manifestations, treatments, and screening recommendations. Outcomes of clinical trials for treatment of sickle cell retinopathy are presented.

Study Design: Case report. Results: A 24-year-old African man presented with a hypertensive herpetic keratouveitis. A brutal lowering of the intraocular pressure (IOP) by systemic acetazolamide resulted in a ocular decompression retinopathy and multiple arterial occlusions involving the macular and the mid-periphery retina. A hemoglobin electrophoresis revealed a sickle cell trait. Conclusion: Under rare circumstances, vaso occlusive events can occur in patients with a sickle cell trait. We identified high IOP and acetazolamide to be responsible of an increased blood viscosity and a reduction of the vessels’ caliber, resulting in sickling and arterial retinal occlusions. We recommend a thorough anamnesis and a sickle cell screening for patients of African or Mediterranean descent with acute elevated IOP, especially if they have to be treated with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

56,Multitarget Activities of Müller Glial Cells and Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 1 in Proliferative Retinopathies,2022,ASN Neuro,"Müller glial cells (MGCs), the main glial component of the retina, play an active role in retinal homeostasis during development and pathological processes. They strongly monitor retinal environment and, in response to retinal imbalance, activate neuroprotective mechanisms mainly characterized by the increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Under these circumstances, if homeostasis is not reestablished, the retina can be severely injured and GFAP contributes to neuronal degeneration, as they occur in several proliferative retinopathies such as diabetic retinopathy, sickle cell retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity. In addition, MGCs have an active participation in inflammatory responses releasing proinflammatory mediators and metalloproteinases to the extracellular space and vitreous cavity. MGCs are also involved in the retinal neovascularization and matrix extracellular remodeling during the proliferative stage of retinopathies. Interestingly, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and its ligand α2-macroglobulin (α2M) are highly expressed in MGCs and they have been established to participate in multiple cellular and molecular activities with relevance in retinopathies. However, the exact mechanism of regulation of retinal LRP1 in MGCs is still unclear. Thus, the active participation of MGCs and LRP1 in these diseases, strongly supports the potential interest of them for the design of novel therapeutic approaches. In this review, we discuss the role of LRP1 in the multiple MGCs activities involved in the development and progression of proliferative retinopathies, identifying opportunities in the field that beg further research in this topic area. Summary Statement MGCs and LRP1 are active players in injured retinas, participating in key features such as gliosis and neurotoxicity, neovascularization, inflammation, and glucose control homeostasis during the progression of ischemic diseases, such as proliferative retinopathies. © The Author(s) 2022.","['alpha 2 macroglobulin', '  cyclin dependent kinase 2', '  gelatinase A', '  gelatinase B', '  glial fibrillary acidic protein', '  glucose transporter 1', '  glutamate ammonia ligase', '  immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein', '  intercellular adhesion molecule 1', '  interleukin 1beta', '  interleukin 6', '  low density lipoprotein receptor', '  low density lipoprotein receptor related protein', '  metalloproteinase', '  monocyte chemotactic protein 1', '  monocyte chemotactic protein 2', '  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase 1', '  somatomedin C', '  sphingosine 1 phosphate', '  STAT3 protein', '  tissue plasminogen activator', '  toll like receptor 2', '  toll like receptor 3', '  toll like receptor 4', '  toll like receptor 5', '  tumor necrosis factor', '  vasculotropin', '  vimentin', '  glial fibrillary acidic protein', '  low density lipoprotein', '  low density lipoprotein receptor related protein', '  adipocyte', '  aerobic glycolysis', '  diabetes mellitus', '  disease exacerbation', '  epithelium cell', '  fibroblast', '  gene expression', '  glia cell', '  gliosis', '  glucose homeostasis', '  human', '  hypoxia', '  immunohistochemistry', '  inflammation', '  internalization (cell)', '  liver cell', '  macrophage', '  MAPK signaling', '  monocyte', '  mTOR signaling', '  Mueller cell', '  nerve degeneration', '  neurotoxicity', '  photoreceptor', '  protein expression', '  retina cell', '  retina neovascularization', '  retinopathy', '  Review', '  signal transduction', '  vascular smooth muscle cell', '  macroglia', '  metabolism', '  newborn', '  pathology', '  retina', '  retina neovascularization', '  Ependymoglial Cells', '  Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', '  Humans', '  Infant', ' Newborn', '  Lipoproteins', ' LDL', '  Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-1', '  Retina', '  Retinal Neovascularization']",3.0,SAGE Publications Inc.,English,Review,['Argentina'],[Fondo],['Argentina'],2014 - 2023,1
57,The Impact of Optical Coherence Tomography in the Early Identification of Children with Sickle Cell Retinopathy,2022,International Journal of Clinical Practice,"Introduction. Sickle cell disease is characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin, which affects hemoglobin molecule stability during hypoxia and leads to the formation of sickle cells, resulting in increased hematic viscosity, hemolysis, and microvascular blockage. Vasoocclusion is assumed to be the primary cause of vision-threatening retinopathy in sickle cell disease. The aim of this study was to improve the early detection of sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and investigate the link between systemic and ocular symptoms. Methods. This cross-sectional study comprised children with SCD. The patient files provided a detailed medical history. The laboratory tests included a blood count, reticulocyte count, and Hb electrophoresis. The slit lamp, fundus, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) were all part of the ophthalmological examination. Results. The study comprised 15 children with sickle cell disease who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, with a mean age of 11.15 ± 1.29 years. Nine of the children were males (60%) and six were females (40%). 8 (53.3%) of the children had Hb SS, three (20%) had Hb SC, three (20%) had Hb SB+, and one (6.7%) had Hb SB0. Four children (26.7%) had poor visual acuity. A fundus examination revealed significant abnormal findings in 12 of the 7 children's eyes (40 percent). Macular thinning was detected by OCT in 10 eyes of 7 children (33.3%). Flow voids at the deep retinal capillary plexus were detected by OCTA in 10 eyes of 7 children (33.3%). Longer disease duration, higher reticulocytic percent, more painful crises, and noncompliance with hydroxyurea medication were all linked to the existence of eye abnormalities on fundus examination and OCT. Conclusion. OCTA can show early retinal damage in sickle cell patients with macular changes. Sickle cell retinopathy is usually associated with more severe disease. © 2022 Ashraf Abdelkader et al.","['hydroxyurea', '  adolescent', '  Article', '  child', '  clinical article', '  cross-sectional study', '  disease duration', '  exchange blood transfusion', '  female', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  human', '  macular degeneration', '  macular thickness', '  male', '  optical coherence tomography', '  optical coherence tomography angiography', '  patient compliance', '  reticulocyte count', '  retina capillary', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  visual acuity', '  adverse event', '  complication', '  fluorescence angiography', '  optical coherence tomography', '  procedures', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Child', '  Cross-Sectional Studies', '  Female', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence']",1.0,Hindawi Limited,English,Article,"['Egypt', ' Saudi Arabia']",[],['Egypt'],2014 - 2023,2
58,Evolving Strategies in the Management of Sickle Cell Disease in the 21st Century and the Role of the Pediatrician,2022,Pediatric Annals,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common genetic disorders in the United States. Once a fatal disease of childhood, the majority of patients born with SCD who live in a developed country will survive to adulthood (albeit with slightly shortened life spans). Despite numerous novel therapeutic advancements in recent years that serve to mitigate the symptoms associated with SCD, the only cure for SCD is a hematopoi-etic stem cell transplant. The overall survival for patients with a matched sibling donor transplant is greater than 90%. However, fewer than 20% of patients with SCD in the US have a 12/12 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling donor. In contrast, most patients have at least one HLA haploidentical first-degree relative, which expands the donor pool for patients who have diseases amenable to stem cell transplantation such as SCD. © SLACK Incorporated.","['aldehyde dehydrogenase', '  busulfan', '  crizanlizumab', '  cyclophosphamide', '  fludarabine', '  glutamine', '  hemoglobin F', '  hemoglobin S', '  HLA A antigen', '  HLA antigen', '  HLA B antigen', '  HLA C antigen', '  HLA DPB1 antigen', '  HLA DQB1 antigen', '  HLA DRB1 antigen', '  hydroxyurea', '  lentivirus vector', '  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', '  PADGEM protein', '  thymocyte antibody', '  voxelotor', '  acute chest syndrome', '  acute myeloid leukemia', '  alloimmunization', '  Article', '  beta thalassemia', '  bone marrow suppression', '  chemotherapy', '  end stage renal disease', '  erythrocyte transfusion', '  fever', '  gene therapy', '  genotype', '  graft versus host reaction', '  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '  hemolytic anemia', '  HLA typing', '  human', '  immunization', '  iron overload', '  learning disorder', '  osteomyelitis', '  overall survival', '  oxidative stress', '  oxygen affinity', '  prophylaxis', '  pulmonary hypertension', '  quality of life', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  transcranial Doppler ultrasonography', '  adult', '  donor', '  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '  pediatrician', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '  Humans', '  Pediatricians', '  Tissue Donors']",0.0,Slack Incorporated,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1

We used automated RBCx to treat acute and chronic complications in 75 children with SCD who had a median age of 10 years [7–13]. We analyzed 649 RBCx sessions. Peripheral venous access was limited in a number of the children, and thus a femoral double-lumen central venous catheter was required. We recommend heparin locking with 500 units in each lumen of the catheter. To prevent complications, we ensured that all patients had achieved a post-RCE HbS level of < 30%. For chronic transfusion, with a post-RCE Hb level of approximately 10–11 g/dL, a blood exchange volume of ≥ 32 mL/kg, and an interval between each RBCx procedure of ≤ 30 days, the residual HbS level was maintained below 30%. For acute transfusion, a post-exchange Hb level ≥ 10 g/dL (p < 0.001) and a total exchange volume ≥ 35 mL/kg (p = 0.001) were the best way to reduce HbS to < 30%. AUC was 0.84.

60,Retinopathy in Egyptian patients with sickle cell disease: A cross-sectional study,2021,Medicine (United States),"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a disorder that causes red blood cells to become sticky and rigid. Sickle cells can block blood flow in small blood vessels depriving the eye of oxygen and cause damage. This is called sickle retinopathy that can progress to severe proliferative sickle cell retinopathy, bleeding into the eye, detachment of the retina or even loss of vision. To assess ocular manifestations and detect frequency of retinopathy in patients with SCD. Cross-sectional study was conducted on 32 patients with SCD. They were 22 males and 10 females with mean age of 12 years. Routine investigations as well as ophthalmological examination including visual acuity, fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography were done. We found that 8 patients (25%) suffered from proliferative retinopathy, 10 patients (31%) showed tortuous retinal veins, while 14 patients (44%) were normal. All patients showed macular thinning on optical coherence tomography examination. We concluded that frequency of retinopathy in patients with SCD is more than expected and it was higher in patients who started transfusion at a later age. More attention should be paid for this problem and close observations and follow up is strongly needed. Copyright © 2021 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

62,A systematic review of cases of West African crystalline maculopathy,2021,International Journal of Clinical Practice,"Aim: West African crystalline maculopathy (WACM) is, reportedly, a rare condition whose aetiology remains unclear. This study aims to describe the epidemiology, summarizing the identified risk factors and clinical characteristics of cases of WACM, with the goal of highlighting presentation patterns and the clinical course of the condition. Methods: A comprehensive PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, OMIM and Google scholar search of all articles written in English, and non-English language articles with abstract translated to English on WACM was carried out. Only full case reports and series were included. Data reviewed included epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentations, imaging characteristics, management and prognosis of WACM. Information on the location of the study was also extracted. Results: Ten studies — seven case reports and three case series - comprising of 30 patients were included. The patients were from West, Central and North-east Africa, with all the studies carried out in North America and Europe. The majority of the patients (76.7%) had diabetes mellitus, 80% had a vascular retinopathy (diabetic retinopathy, sickle cell retinopathy, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy and branch retinal vein occlusion) and 50% had macular oedema. There was no report of associated visual impairment or retinal degeneration. Clinical improvement in the number of crystals was documented in two cases with retinal laser photocoagulation for associated vascular retinopathies. Clinical observation was employed by most clinicians. Conclusion: West African crystalline retinopathy is a seemingly innocuous condition affecting black or African people, who were also born in Africa. The majority of the patients have a vascular retinopathy. Longitudinal studies, particularly in Africa, may be required to elucidate the aetiology, as well as the long-term prognosis, of the crystals. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","['branch retinal vein occlusion', '  comorbidity', '  diabetes mellitus', '  familial exudative vitreoretinopathy', '  first-degree relative', '  geographic distribution', '  human', '  laser coagulation', '  nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy', '  optical coherence tomography', '  prognosis', '  proliferative diabetic retinopathy', '  retina fluorescein angiography', '  retina macula cystoid edema', '  retina maculopathy', '  retinopathy', '  Review', '  risk factor', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  systematic review', '  West African', '  West African crystalline maculopathy', '  Africa', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  macular edema', '  retina disease', '  Africa', '  Diabetic Retinopathy', '  Humans', '  Laser Coagulation', '  Macular Edema', '  Retinal Diseases']",2.0,John Wiley and Sons Inc,English,Review,"['Niger', ' Nigeria', ' United States']",[],"['Niger', 'Nigeria']",2014 - 2023,3
63,Severe COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a sickle cell disease adult patient: case report,2021,BMC Pulmonary Medicine,"Background: Sickle-cell anaemia is a widespread genetic disease prevalent worldwide among African and African-American populations. The pathogenesis is most often revealed by pulmonary conditions, including acute thoracic syndrome, which is affecting the life expectancy of these populations. The global spread of CoV2-SARS infection with a respiratory tropism, endothelial damages and procoagulant status endangers the SCD population. However, with only a few case reports, consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on SCD population remain poorly known. Case presentation: We report a case of a 33-year-old man with a history of homozygous SS homozygous sickle cell anemia who consulted on March 24, 2020 for febrile dyspnea 11 days after the onset of symptoms. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. His respiratory status worsened rapidly in the emergency room and then in ICU leading to severe ARDS requiring intubation, curarization, and venovenous ECMO. Hematologically, severe hemolysis associated with major thrombocytopenia without documented spinal cord injury was noted. Several transfusion exchanges are performed. The evolution was finally slowly favorable and led to discharge from the intensive care unit and then from the hospital. Conclusions: This case recalls the importance of an increased prevention policy against COVID-19among the SCD population. In addition, from a therapeutic point of view, it advocates (1) a high preventive anticoagulation from the outset according to the level of D-dimers (2) the use of venovenous ECMO in this particular case, whereas this technique has had rather disappointing results in acute chest syndromes. (3) Unexpectedly, our patient did not develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and acute cor pulmonale (ACP), whereas this is a common feature of ARDS during SCD. These last two observations suggest a different pathophysiology of pulmonary disorders in SCD patients in the case of SARS COv2. It could be associated with marked hypoxemia secondary to pulmonary vascular vasodilation. © 2021, The Author(s).","['antibiotic agent', '  corticosteroid', '  D dimer', '  acute chest syndrome', '  adult', '  adult respiratory distress syndrome', '  anemia', '  antibiotic therapy', '  Article', '  artificial ventilation', '  bacterium culture', '  blood culture', '  bone marrow biopsy', '  case report', '  clinical article', '  coronavirus disease 2019', '  coughing', '  Doppler flowmetry', '  dyspnea', '  erythrocyte transfusion', '  exchange blood transfusion', '  fever', '  follow up', '  glomerulus filtration rate', '  headache', '  hemolysis', '  hospital discharge', '  human', '  hypoxemia', '  inflammation', '  intubation', '  larynx edema', '  lung alveolitis', '  lung infiltrate', '  lung lavage', '  lymphocytic alveolitis', '  lymphocytopenia', '  male', '  microalbuminuria', '  nasopharyngeal swab', '  obesity', '  protein blood level', '  reticulocytopenia', '  retinopathy', '  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell crisis', '  thorax radiography', '  thromboembolism', '  transthoracic echocardiography', '  vein embolism', '  veno-venous ECMO', '  complication', '  extracorporeal oxygenation', '  pandemic', '  procedures', '  respiratory distress syndrome', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  COVID-19', '  Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Pandemics', '  Radiography', ' Thoracic', '  Respiration', ' Artificial', '  Respiratory Distress Syndrome', '  SARS-CoV-2']",4.0,BioMed Central Ltd,English,Article,['France'],[],['France'],2014 - 2023,1

This thematic synthesis based on an iterative literature review conducted in Medline and Google Scholar pertaining to diabetes with coexistent asymmetry of retinopathy included 45 original articles, 21 case reports and series, and 18 review articles from 1965 to 2020. Asymmetric DR is defined as proliferative DR (PDR) in one eye and nonproliferative, preproliferative, background, or no DR in the other eye lasting for at least 2 years. It is observed in 5%-10% of patients with PDR. Associated factors can be divided into (i) vascular: carotid obstructive disease, ocular ischemic syndrome, and retinal vascular diseases; (ii) Inflammatory: uveitis, endophthalmitis, and Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis; (iii) degenerative: posterior vitreous detachment, high myopia and anisometropia, uveal coloboma, retinal detachment, retinitis pigmentosa, and chorioretinal atrophy and scarring; (iv) cataract surgery and vitrectomy; and (v) miscellaneous: elevated intraocular pressure, glaucoma, amblyopia, retinal detachment, and optic atrophy. The gamut of diagnostic modalities for asymmetric DR includes thorough ocular examination, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, fundus photography, fundus fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, and newer modalities such as ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography angiography, along with a complete systemic evaluation and carotid Doppler studies. The differential diagnosis includes other causes of retinal neovascularization that may present in an asymmetric manner, such as sickle cell retinopathy, retinal vein occlusions, and featureless retina. This review discusses in detail the aforementioned considerations and draws a comprehensive picture of asymmetric DR in order to sensitize ophthalmologists to this important condition.","['complication', '  diabetes mellitus', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  fluorescence angiography', '  human', '  optical coherence tomography', '  retina', '  retina disease', '  Diabetes Mellitus', '  Diabetic Retinopathy', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Humans', '  Retina', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence']",5.0,NLM (Medline),English,Review,['India'],[],[],2014 - 2023,1
66,Prevalence of dark without pressure and angioid streaks in sickle cell disease,2021,Ophthalmic Surgery Lasers and Imaging Retina,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of areas of dark without pressure (DWOP) and angioid streaks (AS) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a consecutive series of 77 adults with SCD. RESULTS: DWOP appeared as multiple patches in 35 of the affected eyes and as a single lesion in 3 eyes. OCT finding demonstrated the ellipsoid layer was hyporeflective in DWOP. AS were identified in six cases (3.9%) and were bilateral in five cases. The prevalence of AS was higher with increasing age, being 67% in the patients older than age 45 years. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of DWOP in adults with SCD is 25% in this study, which is higher than previously reported, and the prevalence of AS is around 4%, which is midway between prior estimates. Recognition of the clinical examination and imaging features of DWOP reduce the need for additional investigation. © 2021 Slack Incorporated.

68,Two-dimensional mathematical modelling of retinal oxygen transport and recommending treatment options,2021,Biomedical Physics and Engineering Express,"This paper presents a novel two-dimensional (2D) computational modeling of the retinal oxygen delivery, transport, and consumption analysis. The 2D modeling allows the division of the retina into four layers to address different flow profiles. The retina domain was meshed using the ICEM CFD mesher, while the ANSYS Fluent was used to calculate the transport phenomena for the four different layers. Clinical cases such as diabetes and sickle cell anaemia denoting the effects of decreasing retinal blood flow and hemoglobin's oxygen affinity were investigated. The simulation results showed that for a healthy retina in light and dark conditions, the outer retina is in danger of hypoxia at thickness >197.56 μm. However, the treatment of severe ischaemia using extreme hyperoxia seems beneficial for retinal thickness >197.56 μm but harmful for thickness <122.75 μm. The reduction of hemoglobin's oxygen affinity at low blood flow regimes could not improve the retina's oxygen levels. The study supports the oxygen toxicity hypothesis that hypoxia causes retina degeneration and estimates the retinal thickness and lighting conditions (dark or light) this may occur. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","['Blood', '  Computational fluid dynamics', '  Hemodynamics', '  Hemoglobin', '  Ophthalmology', '  Different layers', '  Healthy retinas', '  Lighting conditions', '  Oxygen transport', '  Retina degeneration', '  Retinal blood flow', '  Transport phenomena', '  Two-dimensional (2D) computational model', '  Oxygen', '  hemoglobin', '  hemoglobin', '  oxygen', '  Article', '  case report', '  clinical article', '  computer model', '  controlled study', '  cornea', '  diabetic patient', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  hemoglobin blood level', '  human', '  human tissue', '  inner retina', '  Michaelis Menten kinetics', '  oxygen consumption', '  oxygen toxicity', '  oxygen transport', '  partial pressure', '  retina blood flow', '  retina disease', '  retina tissue', '  retinal thickness', '  sickle cell anemia', '  thermodynamics', '  two-dimensional imaging', '  hyperoxia', '  hypoxia', '  retina', '  Hemoglobins', '  Humans', '  Hyperoxia', '  Hypoxia', '  Oxygen', '  Retina']",1.0,IOP Publishing Ltd,English,Article,"['United Kingdom', ' Ghana']",[],['United Kingdom'],2014 - 2023,2
69,"COVID-19 and Hemoglobinopathies: A Systematic Review of Clinical Presentations, Investigations, and Outcomes",2021,Frontiers in Medicine,"This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of the clinical profile and outcome of COVID-19 infection in patients with hemoglobinopathy. The rate of COVID-19 mortality and its predictors were also identified. A systematic search was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines in five electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, WHO COVID-19 database) for articles published between 1st December 2019 to 31st October 2020. All articles with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases with underlying hemoglobinopathy were included. Methodological quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklists. Thirty-one articles with data on 246 patients with hemoglobinopathy were included in this review. In general, clinical manifestations of COVID-19 infection among patients with hemoglobinopathy were similar to the general population. Vaso-occlusive crisis occurred in 55.6% of sickle cell disease patients with COVID-19 infection. Mortality from COVID-19 infection among patients with hemoglobinopathy was 6.9%. After adjusting for age, gender, types of hemoglobinopathy and oxygen supplementation, respiratory (adj OR = 89.63, 95% CI 2.514–3195.537, p = 0.014) and cardiovascular (adj OR = 35.20, 95% CI 1.291–959.526, p = 0.035) comorbidities were significant predictors of mortality. Patients with hemoglobinopathy had a higher mortality rate from COVID-19 infection compared to the general population. Those with coexisting cardiovascular or respiratory comorbidities require closer monitoring during the course of illness. More data are needed to allow a better understanding on the clinical impact of COVID-19 infections among patients with hemoglobinopathy.

Methodology: This retrospective study included 182 eyes of 172 patients managed in the vitreoretinal unit between 2016 and 2019 who were treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF bevacizumab (1.25 mg/0.05 ml) with at least 1 year of follow-up. The outcome measures were change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) over 1 year of follow-up, the number of injections taken, and complications. Results: The mean age was 61.1 ± 16.3 years (male-to-female ratio of 1:1.1) and about 62.1% above >60 years. A total of 330 injections were given during the period audited. The mean number of injections was 1.8 ± 0.93. Ninety-four (51.7%) eyes had only one injection, while 33 (18.1%), 50 (27.5%), and 5 (2.7%) had 2, 3, and 4 injections, respectively. About 78.5% had moderate-to-severe visual impairment at baseline and 44.5%, 16.4%, 12.6%, and 7.1% at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post injections, respectively. The mean BCVA improved for all eyes from 1.67 ± 0.91 logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) at baseline to 1.50 ± 1.27 logMAR at 1 year. The logMAR letters gained was 23 at 1 month and 8.25 at 1 year; the eyes that had three injections gained 10 letters, while those that had one injection gained three letters. Eyes with age-related macular degeneration and idiopathic polypoidal choroidopathy gained 7.5 and 9 letters, respectively, at 1 year after at least three injections. There was a statistically significant association between an increasing number of injections and improved visual outcome (P = 0.043). One patient each developed endophthalmitis (0.6%) and inferior retinal detachment (0.6%) post injection. Conclusion: Visual acuity gain was recorded in patients who had intravitreal anti-VEGF injections in 1 year.

73,Artificial intelligence for improving sickle cell retinopathy diagnosis and management,2021,Eye (Basingstoke),"Sickle cell retinopathy is often initially asymptomatic even in proliferative stages, but can progress to cause vision loss due to vitreous haemorrhages or tractional retinal detachments. Challenges with access and adherence to screening dilated fundus examinations, particularly in medically underserved areas where the burden of sickle cell disease is highest, highlight the need for novel approaches to screening for patients with vision-threatening sickle cell retinopathy. This article reviews the existing literature on and suggests future research directions for coupling artificial intelligence with multimodal retinal imaging to expand access to automated, accurate, imaging-based screening for sickle cell retinopathy. Given the variability in retinal specialist practice patterns with regards to monitoring and treatment of sickle cell retinopathy, we also discuss recent progress toward development of machine learning models that can quantitatively track disease progression over time. These artificial intelligence-based applications have great potential for informing evidence-based and resource-efficient clinical diagnosis and management of sickle cell retinopathy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.","['artificial intelligence', '  automation', '  evidence based practice', '  eye photography', '  health care access', '  human', '  medical specialist', '  multimodal imaging', '  optical coherence tomography', '  optical coherence tomography angiography', '  practice guideline', '  retina fluorescein angiography', '  retinography', '  retinopathy', '  Review', '  sickle cell', '  sickle cell anemia', '  staging', '  ultra widefield fundus photography', '  artificial intelligence', '  retina', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  vitreous hemorrhage', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Artificial Intelligence', '  Humans', '  Retina', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Vitreous Hemorrhage']",2.0,Springer Nature,English,Review,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
74,Maculopathy in sickle cell disease [Makulopathie bei Sichelzellerkrankung],2021,Ophthalmologe,"Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy, which leads to microcirculatory disturbances of various organ systems through recurrent vaso-occlusive episodes, with a possibly fatal outcome. Sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) is the best described ocular manifestation of SCD. Irrespective of the presence of peripheral SCR, sickle cell maculopathy (SCM) can occur early in the course of the disease. Methods: Review of the international and German literature on ocular involvement in SCD with a focus on SCR and SCM and an overview of current systemic therapeutic approaches in SCD on the occasion of the presentation of two patients with HbSS SCD. Results and conclusion: In contrast to SCR, SCM with temporal thinning of the inner retinal layers has only been increasingly described in the literature in the last 5 years, with the advent of SD-OCT and OCTA. Irrespective of the presence of SCR, as many as about half of the patients may develop SCM early in the course of the disease. As a result of progress in systemic therapeutic options and due to migration, the clinical picture will occur more often also in Germany. By knowing about this complication of SCD an early diagnosis can be made and unnecessary diagnostics can be avoided. © 2021, The Author(s).","['complication', '  human', '  macular degeneration', '  microcirculation', '  retina', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Humans', '  Macular Degeneration', '  Microcirculation', '  Retina', '  Retinal Diseases']",1.0,Springer Medizin,German,Review,['Germany'],[],['Germany'],2014 - 2023,1
75,Rheological Impact of GBT1118 Cessation in a Sickle Mouse Model,2021,Frontiers in Physiology,"In sickle cell disease (SCD), higher whole blood viscosity is a risk factor for vaso-occlusive crisis, avascular necrosis, and proliferative retinopathy. Blood viscosity is strongly impacted by hemoglobin (Hb) levels and red blood cell (RBC) deformability. Voxelotor is a hemoglobin S (HbS) polymerization inhibitor with anti-sickling properties that increases the Hb affinity for oxygen, thereby reducing HbS polymerization. In clinical trials, voxelotor increased Hb by an average of 1g/dl, creating concern that this rise in Hb could increase viscosity, particularly when the drug was cleared. To investigate this potential rebound hyperviscosity effect, we treated SCD mice with GBT1118, a voxelotor analog, and stopped the treatment to determine the effect on blood viscosity and RBC deformability under a range of oxygen concentrations. GBT1118 treatment increased Hb, improved RBC deformability by increasing the elongation index under normoxic (EImax) and hypoxic conditions (EImin), and decreased the point of sickling (PoS) without increasing blood viscosity. The anti-sickling effects and improvement of RBC deformability balanced the effect of increased Hb such that there was no increase in blood viscosity. Forty-eight hours after ceasing GBT1118, Hb declined from the rise induced by treatment, viscosity did not increase, and EImin remained elevated compared to control animals. Hb and PoS were not different from control animals, suggesting a return to native oxygen affinity and clearance of the drug. RBC deformability did not return to baseline, suggesting some residual rheological improvement. These data suggest that concerns regarding viscosity rise above pre-treatment levels upon sudden cessation of voxelotor are not warranted. © Copyright © 2021 Kanne, Nebor, Pochron, Oksenberg and Sheehan.","['gbt 1118', '  hemoglobin S', '  unclassified drug', '  voxelotor', '  animal cell', '  animal experiment', '  animal model', '  Article', '  blood viscosity', '  controlled study', '  drug clearance', '  drug half life', '  erythrocyte deformability', '  mouse', '  nonhuman', '  oxygen affinity', '  sickle cell anemia']",1.0,Frontiers Media S.A.,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
76,Feasibility and Clinical Utility of Ultra-Widefield–Navigated Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging,2021,Journal of VitreoRetinal Diseases,"Purpose: This work aims to evaluate the clinical utility and feasibility of a novel scanning laser ophthalmoscope-based navigated ultra-widefield swept-source optical coherence tomography (UWF SS-OCT) imaging system. Methods: A retrospective, single-center, consecutive case series evaluated patients between September 2019 and October 2020 with UWF SS-OCT (modified Optos P200TxE, Optos PLC) as part of routine retinal care. The logistics of image acquisition, interpretability of images captured, nature of the peripheral abnormality, and clinical utility in management decisions were recorded. Results: Eighty-two eyes from 72 patients were included. Patients were aged 59.4 ± 17.1 years (range, 8-87 years). During imaging, 4.4 series of images were obtained in 4.1 minutes, with 86.4% of the image series deemed to be diagnostic of the peripheral pathology on blinded image review. The most common pathologic findings were chorioretinal scars (18 eyes). In 31 (38%) eyes, these images were meaningful in supporting clinical decision-making with definitive findings. Diagnoses imaged included retinal detachment combined with retinoschisis, retinal hole with overlying vitreous traction and subretinal fluid, vitreous inflammation overlying a peripheral scar, Coats disease, and peripheral retinal traction in sickle cell retinopathy. Conclusions: Navigated UWF SS-OCT imaging was clinically practical and provided high-quality characterization of peripheral retinal lesions for all eyes. Images directly contributed to management plans, including laser, injection or surgical treatment, for a clinically meaningful set of patients (38%). Future studies are needed to further assess the value of this imaging modality and its role in diagnosing, monitoring, and treating peripheral lesions. © The Author(s) 2021.",,2.0,SAGE Publications Inc.,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
77,"Prevalence of ocular abnormalities in relation to sickle cell disease severity among children in South-western, Nigeria",2021,European Journal of Ophthalmology,"Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD) ranks high among genetic disorders worldwide. It is characterised by repeated vaso-occlusion with resultant end-organ damage. This process can occur in all vascular beds in the body, including ocular blood vessels and may cause irreversible blindness in advanced stages. Little is known of the relationship between the prevalence of ocular abnormalities among children with SCD and their disease severity. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out at the Paediatric Haematology Clinics and the Eye Centre of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (OAUTHC), Ile-Ife. Children with SCD in steady state were recruited from the Haematology Clinics and examined for ocular abnormalities at the Eye Centre of the hospital. The subjects SCD severity grade was determined using a previously validated scoring system. Results: One hundred and twenty (120) children aged 5 to 15 years were examined. Of these, 72 had one or more ocular abnormalities giving the prevalence of ocular abnormalities among them to be 60.0%. Though a higher proportion of children with moderate disease, 23 (65.7%) of 35, compared to those with mild disease, 49 (57.6%) of 85 had ocular abnormalities, this difference was not statistically significant, p = 0.412. Conclusion: Ocular abnormalities among Nigerian children with SCD are common even in steady-state, but not significantly associated with disease severity. Periodic screening for ocular abnormalities should thus be done on them irrespective of disease severity. © The Author(s) 2020.","['hemoglobin', '  tetracaine', '  tropicamide', '  adolescent', '  anterior eye segment', '  Article', '  cataract', '  cause of death', '  chemoprophylaxis', '  child', '  cross-sectional study', '  depigmentation', '  descriptive research', '  disease severity', '  electrophoresis', '  eye disease', '  female', '  genetic disorder', '  glaucoma', '  hematocrit', '  heredity', '  human', '  hydration', '  hyperpigmentation', '  hyphema', '  intraocular pressure', '  leukocyte count', '  major clinical study', '  malaria', '  male', '  Nigeria', '  nutrition', '  optic disk', '  optic nerve atrophy', '  posterior eye segment', '  prevalence', '  retina', '  retina blood vessel', '  retina macula lutea', '  scoring system', '  sickle cell anemia', '  slit lamp microscopy', '  social class', '  visual acuity', '  visual impairment', '  complication', '  prevalence', '  severity of illness index', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Cross-Sectional Studies', '  Humans', '  Nigeria', '  Prevalence', '  Severity of Illness Index']",1.0,SAGE Publications Ltd,English,Article,"['Niger', ' Nigeria']",[],"['Niger', 'Nigeria']",2014 - 2023,2

Materials and Methods: All well individuals with sickle cell disease patients 14 years and older, not pregnant and without a history of clinical stroke were consecutively recruited. Anthropometric measurements, hematology studies, an analgesia checklist, and the Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement Information System questionnaire were completed. The painDETECT questionnaire was completed to describe NP and pain patterns - from which CP was defined. Results: There were 257 patients in total, with 55.6% being females; the mean age of the patients was 31.7±12 years, and 75% had the SS genotype. Almost all patients (92.6%) had had an acute pain crisis in their lifetime and 72.4% in the last year. The mean severity at last attack was 6.8±3.1 on a scale of 0 to 10. The prevalences of CP and NP were 21.5% and 17.9%, respectively. Female sex, the presence of current leg ulcers, and the use of a strong opioid in the last 4 weeks produced higher odds of NP, whereas older age, milder genotypes, and daily analgesic use had the highest odds of CP. Opioids were used by 40.1% of the patients in the previous 4 weeks, whereas nonpharmacological treatments such as physiotherapy was less used, but reported to be very effective. Discussion: CP and NP should be assessed during routine care of sickle cell pain so that targeted therapies can be applied. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

80,Retinal ultra-wide-field colour imaging versus dilated fundus examination to screen for sickle cell retinopathy,2021,British Journal of Ophthalmology,"Purpose To compare ultra-wide-field colour fundus imaging (UWFI) to dilated fundus examination (DFE) for the screening of sickle cell retinopathy (SCR). Design This study is a prospective, blinded, multicentre case series. Participants This study included two groups: an adult group (n=268 eyes) and a paediatric group (n=168 eyes). Sickle cell disease (SCD) types included haemoglobin S homozygous (HbSS), haemoglobin S and C (HbSC) and Hb S with β-thalassaemia (HbSß-Thal). Methods Participants underwent DFE and UWFI. Each eye received three independent grades (1-4), documented by three graders: clinical grader, image grader 1 and image grader 2. Three clinically relevant diagnostic thresholds were determined. Based on these thresholds, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for all three graders were calculated relative to each other as reference tests. Results HbSC was associated with the most advanced SCR grades. When compared to the clinical grader, image grader 1 and image grader 2 consistently detected more SCR and higher SCR grades in both adult and paediatric groups. In both groups, image grader 1 and image grader 2 identified twice as many cases of capillary occlusion/anastomosis than clinical grader. To detect the presence of any proliferative SCR, image grader 1 and image grader 2 had a sensitivity of 82%, 71% in the paediatrics group and 90% and 72% in the adult group. The clinical grader sensitivity was 52% in the paediatrics group and 53% in the adult group. Conclusion The UWFI is a sensitive tool to screen for SCR. It is superior to DFE in detecting capillary occlusion or anastomosis. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

84,Monitoring retinal pathology and cerebral injury in sickle cell disease using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography in pediatric patients,2021,Pediatric Blood and Cancer,"Purpose: This study aimed to confirm the correlation between sickle cell disease (SCD) genotype and retinal damage identified by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and examine a potential link between hypoxic ischemic injury in the retina and brain. Methods: In this prospective, observational case series, 117 patients (56 males) aged 5–20 years with SCD (36 SC, 68 SS, eight Sβ+ thalassemia, five Sβ0 thalassemia) underwent ophthalmologic examination including funduscopy and SD-OCT imaging. Comparison of SCD genotypes and association between ocular findings and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) in subjects with SS/Sβ0 genotype were investigated. Results: Visual acuity ranged from 20/20 to 20/40. On funduscopic exam, 16 of 117 (13.7%) had retinopathy; 69 of 117 (59.0%) showed inner retina thinning on SD-OCT. Patients with SS/Sβ0 showed a higher frequency of sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) change (68.5% vs. 47.2%), bilateral SCR (49.9% vs. 25.0%), and foveal involvement (15.1% vs. 0) than the SC genotype. While funduscopic findings in our cohort with SS/Sβ0 genotype showed no correlation with CVD, 20 of 21 patients with CVD had abnormal SD-OCT. Elevated reticulocyte percentage and aspartate aminotransferase are associated with SD-OCT changes and CVD. Conclusions: SD-OCT was better than funduscopy in detecting retinal changes, higher frequency, and more extensive retinal changes in the more severe SCD genotypes SS and Sβ0 as compared with SC. The correlation between abnormal SD-OCT and CVD strongly suggests that retinal exam using SD-OCT may aid in detection and monitoring SCD-related CVD. Retinopathy may be another component of the hemolytic subphenotype of SCD. © 2021 The Authors.

86,HIF-1α and HIF-2α redundantly promote retinal neovascularization in patients with ischemic retinal disease,2021,Journal of Clinical Investigation,"Therapies targeting VEGF have proven only modestly effective for the treatment of proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (PSR), the leading cause of blindness in patients with sickle cell disease. Here, we shift our attention upstream from the genes that promote retinal neovascularization (NV) to the transcription factors that regulate their expression. We demonstrated increased expression of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in the ischemic inner retina of PSR eyes. Although both HIFs participated in promoting VEGF expression by hypoxic retinal Müller cells, HIF-1 alone was sufficient to promote retinal NV in mice, suggesting that therapies targeting only HIF-2 would not be adequate to prevent PSR. Nonetheless, administration of a HIF-2–specific inhibitor currently in clinical trials (PT2385) inhibited NV in the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model. To unravel these discordant observations, we examined the expression of HIFs in OIR mice and demonstrated rapid but transient accumulation of HIF-1α but delayed and sustained accumulation of HIF-2α; simultaneous expression of HIF-1α and HIF-2α was not observed. Staggered HIF expression was corroborated in hypoxic adult mouse retinal explants but not in human retinal organoids, suggesting that this phenomenon may be unique to mice. Using pharmacological inhibition or an in vivo nanoparticle-mediated RNAi approach, we demonstrated that inhibiting either HIF was effective for preventing NV in OIR mice. Collectively, these results explain why inhibition of either HIF-1α or HIF-2α is equally effective for preventing retinal NV in mice but suggest that therapies targeting both HIFs will be necessary to prevent NV in patients with PSR.

87,"Sickle Cell Maculopathy: Prevalence, Associations and Impact on Visual Acuity",2021,Ophthalmologica,"Aims: To investigate the prevalence of sickle cell maculopathy (SCM), and associations with age, sex, genotype, proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (PSR) stage, and the impact on visual acuity. Methods: Age, sex, and visual acuity were recorded and spectral domain OCT and ultra-wide-field images of the macula and retina were reviewed in a consecutive series of 74 adults with sickle cell disease. Results: The median age was 37 years (range 19-73 years) and 36 cases (48.6%) were male. SCM was present in at least 1 eye of 40 cases (54.1%) or in 67 of all eyes (42.3%). SCM prevalence was 54.8%, 62.5%, and 25% for the HbSS, HbSC, and HbS/BThal or other genotypes, respectively. SCM was observed in 41 (39.4%) of the eyes with PSR stages 0, 1, and 2, and in 21 (51.2%) of the eyes with PSR stages 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Mild visual impairment or worse was present in 3 eyes (4.8%) with SCM but this was secondary to other pathology. Conclusion: SCM is a frequent finding in the eyes of adults with sickle cell disease. The prevalence is similar for the HbSS and HbSC genotypes and is not related to the PSR stage. High-contrast distance visual acuity is typically preserved. © 2021 S. Karger AG.

88,Effects of genotypes and treatment on oxygenscan parameters in sickle cell disease,2021,Cells,"(1) Background: The aim of the present study was to compare oxygen gradient ektacytometry parameters between sickle cell patients of different genotypes (SS, SC, and S/β+) or under different treat-ments (hydroxyurea or chronic red blood cell exchange). (2) Methods: Oxygen gradient ektacytometry was performed in 167 adults and children at steady state. In addition, five SS patients had oxygenscan measurements at steady state and during an acute complication requiring hospitalization. (3) Results: Red blood cell (RBC) deformability upon deoxygenation (EImin) and in normoxia (EImax) was in-creased, and the susceptibility of RBC to sickle upon deoxygenation was decreased in SC patients when compared to untreated SS patients older than 5 years old. SS patients under chronic red blood cell exchange had higher EImin and EImax and lower susceptibility of RBC to sickle upon deoxygenation compared to untreated SS patients, SS patients younger than 5 years old, and hydroxyurea‐treated SS and SC patients. The susceptibility of RBC to sickle upon deoxygenation was increased in the five SS patients during acute complication compared to steady state, although the difference between steady state and acute complication was variable from one patient to another. (4) Conclusions: The present study demon-strates that oxygen gradient ektacytometry parameters are affected by sickle cell disease (SCD) genotype and treatment. © 2021 by the authors.

89,"Sickle Cell Maculopathy: Microstructural Analysis Using OCTA and Identification of Genetic, Systemic, and Biological Risk Factors",2021,American Journal of Ophthalmology,"Purpose: To identify genetic, systemic, and biological factors associated with the occurrence of sickle cell maculopathy (SCM). To evaluate microvascular macular alterations using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in sickle cell disease (SCD). Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: One hundred fifty-one eyes of 78 adult SCD patients (43 HbSS, 30 HbSC, 4 S/β+, and 1 HbS Lepore) and 40 eyes of 20 healthy controls underwent spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) and OCTA using Spectralis HRA+OCT (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). We analyzed the occurrence of SCM, the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, and the severity of macular ischemia and studied their relationships with genetic, systemic, and biological parameters using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Maculopathy occurred in 66 eyes (44%), and more frequently in HbSS patients (71%, P = .004). Multivariate analysis identified HbSS genotype and lower prothrombin ratio (PR) as independently associated with SCM (P = .01). Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy was also associated with SCM (P = .02). FAZ enlargement was associated with higher lactate dehydrogenase level (P = .02). Macular ischemia was more severe in patients with lower hemoglobin level (P = .004) and lower PR (P = .01). No flow areas were identified with OCTA even in eyes with no macular thinning (36 eyes, 42%) and appeared more frequently in the temporal superior subfield (36%). Conclusions: HbSS genotype, abnormal coagulation and hemolysis increase the risk of SCM. OCTA provides valuable criteria to identify potential risk factors of SCM. OCTA also improves detection of early microvascular changes before the onset of macular thinning. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","['hemoglobin', '  lactate dehydrogenase', '  hemoglobin C', '  hemoglobin S', '  hemoglobin sickle-Lepore', '  hemoglobin variant', '  adult', '  Article', '  controlled study', '  cross-sectional study', '  disease association', '  disease severity', '  enzyme blood level', '  female', '  gene identification', '  genetic risk', '  hemoglobin blood level', '  heredity', '  human', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  optical coherence tomography angiography', '  priority journal', '  retina ischemia', '  retina maculopathy', '  risk factor', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell maculopathy', '  spectral domain optical coherence tomography', '  adolescent', '  blood clotting disorder', '  fluorescence angiography', '  genetics', '  genotype', '  hemolysis', '  middle aged', '  multimodal imaging', '  optical coherence tomography', '  pathology', '  retina blood vessel', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  visual acuity', '  young adult', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Blood Coagulation Disorders', '  Cross-Sectional Studies', '  Female', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Genotype', '  Hemoglobin C', '  Hemoglobin', ' Sickle', '  Hemoglobins', ' Abnormal', '  Hemolysis', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Multimodal Imaging', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retinal Vessels', '  Risk Factors', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence', '  Visual Acuity', '  Young Adult']",2.0,Elsevier Inc.,English,Article,"['France', ' Guadeloupe']",[],['France'],2014 - 2023,2

92,Longitudinal Assessment of Retinal Thinning in Adults with and without Sickle Cell Retinopathy Using Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography,2021,JAMA Ophthalmology,"Importance: Determination of retinal thinning rates may help to identify patients who are at risk of progression of sickle cell retinopathy. Objective: To assess the rates of macular thinning in adults with and without sickle cell retinopathy using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) and to identify ocular and systemic risk factors associated with retinal thinning. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal prospective case-control study enrolled adult participants from a university-based retina subspecialty clinic between February 11, 2009, and July 3, 2019. The study was designed in autumn 2008 and conducted from February 2, 2009, to July 3, 2020. Participants with sickle cell retinopathy (sickle cell group) were matched by age and race with participants without sickle cell retinopathy (control group). Participants received annual spectral-domain OCT and clinical examinations. Those with at least 1 year of follow-up by July 3, 2020, were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from February 2, 2009, to July 3, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was comparison of spectral-domain OCT measurements from early-treatment diabetic retinopathy study subfield rates of retinal thinning between eyes with and without sickle cell retinopathy and between different sickle cell hemoglobin subtypes. The secondary outcome was identification of ocular and systemic risk factors associated with rates of retinal thinning. Results: Among 370 adults (711 eyes) enrolled in the study, 310 participants (606 eyes) had sickle cell retinopathy, and 60 participants (105 eyes) did not. Of those, 175 of 310 participants (56.5%; 344 of 606 eyes [56.8%]; mean [SD] age, 37.8 [12.8] years; 126 women [72.0%]) in the sickle cell group and 31 of 60 participants (51.7%; 46 of 105 eyes [43.8%]; mean [SD] age, 59 [15.4] years; 22 women [71.0%]) in the control group had at least 1 year of clinical and spectral-domain OCT follow-up data from baseline. The mean (SD) follow-up was 53.7 (32.6) months for the sickle cell group and 54.6 (34.9) months for the control group. Rates of macular thinning in the sickle cell group were significantly higher than those in the control group for the inner nasal (difference, -1.18 μm per year; 95% CI, -1.71 to -0.65 μm per year), inner superior (difference, -1.03 μm per year; 95% CI, -1.78 to -0.29 μm per year), inner temporal (difference, -0.61 μm per year; 95% CI, -1.16 to -0.07 μm per year), and outer nasal (difference, -0.41 μm per year; 95% CI, -0.80 to -0.03 μm per year) quadrants. Patients with sickle cell hemoglobin SC and sickle cell hemoglobin β-thalassemia subtypes had higher rates of retinal thinning than those with the sickle cell hemoglobin SS subtype. Risk factors associated with greater rates of retinal thinning included participant age, stage of retinopathy, previous stroke, and presence of hypertension, acute chest syndrome, or diabetes. Hydroxyurea therapy was associated with decreased rates of retinal thinning and may be a protective factor. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, rates of retinal thinning were higher among participants with sickle cell retinopathy compared with those without sickle cell retinopathy, and thinning rates increased with participant age and stage of retinopathy. These findings suggest that identifying anatomic worsening of sickle cell maculopathy through spectral-domain OCT may be a useful parameter to evaluate the progression of sickle cell retinopathy. © 2021 American Medical Association.

94,Deep Learning Detection of Sea Fan Neovascularization from Ultra-Widefield Color Fundus Photographs of Patients with Sickle Cell Hemoglobinopathy,2021,JAMA Ophthalmology,"Importance: Adherence to screening for vision-threatening proliferative sickle cell retinopathy is limited among patients with sickle cell hemoglobinopathy despite guidelines recommending dilated fundus examinations beginning in childhood. An automated algorithm for detecting sea fan neovascularization from ultra-widefield color fundus photographs could expand access to rapid retinal evaluations to identify patients at risk of vision loss from proliferative sickle cell retinopathy. Objective: To develop a deep learning system for detecting sea fan neovascularization from ultra-widefield color fundus photographs from patients with sickle cell hemoglobinopathy. Design, Setting, and Participants: In a cross-sectional study conducted at a single-institution, tertiary academic referral center, deidentified, retrospectively collected, ultra-widefield color fundus photographs from 190 adults with sickle cell hemoglobinopathy were independently graded by 2 masked retinal specialists for presence or absence of sea fan neovascularization. A third masked retinal specialist regraded images with discordant or indeterminate grades. Consensus retinal specialist reference standard grades were used to train a convolutional neural network to classify images for presence or absence of sea fan neovascularization. Participants included nondiabetic adults with sickle cell hemoglobinopathy receiving care from a Wilmer Eye Institute retinal specialist; the patients had received no previous laser or surgical treatment for sickle cell retinopathy and underwent imaging with ultra-widefield color fundus photographs between January 1, 2012, and January 30, 2019. Interventions: Deidentified ultra-widefield color fundus photographs were retrospectively collected. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the convolutional neural network for sea fan detection. Results: A total of 1182 images from 190 patients were included. Of the 190 patients, 101 were women (53.2%), and the mean (SD) age at baseline was 36.2 (12.3) years; 119 patients (62.6%) had hemoglobin SS disease and 46 (24.2%) had hemoglobin SC disease. One hundred seventy-nine patients (94.2%) were of Black or African descent. Images with sea fan neovascularization were obtained in 57 patients (30.0%). The convolutional neural network had an area under the curve of 0.988 (95% CI, 0.969-0.999), with sensitivity of 97.4% (95% CI, 86.5%-99.9%) and specificity of 97.0% (95% CI, 93.5%-98.9%) for detecting sea fan neovascularization from ultra-widefield color fundus photographs. Conclusions and Relevance: This study reports an automated system with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting sea fan neovascularization from ultra-widefield color fundus photographs from patients with sickle cell hemoglobinopathy, with potential applications for improving screening for vision-threatening proliferative sickle cell retinopathy. © 2021 American Medical Association.

95,Cell-derived microparticles and sickle cell disease chronic vasculopathy in sub-Saharan Africa: A multinational study,2021,British Journal of Haematology,"Although most individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) live in sub-Saharan Africa, the natural history of the disease on this continent remains largely unknown. Intravascular haemolysis results in activation of circulating blood cells and release of microparticles (MPs) that exert pro-inflammatory effects and contribute to vascular damage. We designed a case-control study nested in the CADRE cohort (Coeur-Artère-DRÉpanocytose, clinical trials.gov identifier NCTO3114137) and based on extreme phenotypes, to analyse blood cell-derived MPs in 232 adult SS patients at steady state in Bamako and Dakar. Thirty-six healthy adult controls matched by age and sex were recruited in Bamako. The MPs concentrations were higher in SS patients compared to AA controls with a predominance of erythrocyte- and reticulocyte-derived MPs. These erythroid-derived MPs were significantly lower in patients with retinopathy (P = 0·022). Reticulocyte-derived MPs were significantly negatively and positively associated with a history of priapism (P = 0·020) and leg ulcers (P = 0·041) respectively. We describe for the first time the comparative patterns of plasma MPs in healthy subjects and. patients with SCD living in sub-Saharan Africa and exhibiting various complications. Because our present results show no clear pattern of correlation between erythroid MPs and the classical hyper-haemolytic complications, we hypothesise a weak relevance of the hyper-haemolysis versus hyper-viscous paradigm in Africa. © 2020 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","['creatinine', '  hemoglobin', '  adult', '  Africa south of the Sahara', '  Article', '  bone necrosis', '  cohort analysis', '  controlled study', '  creatinine blood level', '  creatinine urine level', '  disease association', '  erythrocyte derived microparticle', '  female', '  flow cytometry', '  high performance liquid chromatography', '  human', '  leg ulcer', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  membrane microparticle', '  phenotype', '  population research', '  priapism', '  priority journal', '  reticulocyte count', '  reticulocyte derived microparticle', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  steady state', '  tricuspid regurgitation velocity', '  case control study', '  clinical trial', '  complication', '  epidemiology', '  hemolysis', '  membrane microparticle', '  pathology', '  sickle cell anemia', '  vascular disease', '  young adult', '  Adult', '  Africa South of the Sahara', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Case-Control Studies', '  Cell-Derived Microparticles', '  Female', '  Hemolysis', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Vascular Diseases', '  Young Adult']",2.0,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,English,Article,"['France', ' Mali', ' Senegal']","[ANR‐11‐IDEX‐0005‐02, Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale]",['France'],2014 - 2023,3
96,Potential causal role of L-glutamine in sickle cell disease painful crises: A Mendelian randomization analysis,2021,"Blood Cells, Molecules, and Diseases","In a recent clinical trial, the metabolite L-glutamine was shown to reduce painful crises in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. To support this observation and identify other metabolites implicated in SCD clinical heterogeneity, we profiled 129 metabolites in the plasma of 705 SCD patients. We tested correlations between metabolite levels and six SCD-related complications (painful crises, cholecystectomy, retinopathy, leg ulcer, priapism, aseptic necrosis) or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and used Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess causality. We found a potential causal relationship between L-glutamine levels and painful crises (N = 1278, odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval] = 0.68 [0.52–0.89], P = 0.0048). In two smaller SCD cohorts (N = 299 and 406), the protective effect of L-glutamine was observed (OR = 0.82 [0.50–1.34]), although the MR result was not significant (P = 0.44). We identified 66 significant correlations between the levels of other metabolites and SCD-related complications or eGFR. We tested these correlations for causality using MR analyses and found no significant causal relationship. The baseline levels of quinolinic acid were associated with prospectively ascertained survival in SCD patients, and this effect was dependent on eGFR.

99,Hemoglobinopathies: ocular manifestations in children and adolescents,2021,Therapeutic Advances in Ophthalmology,"Hemoglobinopathies are genetic disorders that lead to abnormal structure of the hemoglobin molecule. Sickle cell disease, the most common inherited blood disorder, is characterized by defective oxygen transport. Almost every part of the eye can be affected by sickle cell disease; however, proliferative sickle cell retinopathy is the primary cause of vision loss, either from vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment. Here we review the various manifestations of hemoglobinopathies on the eyes of children and adolescents, with a specific focus on sickle cell disease and its different phenotypes. Newer, more sensitive ophthalmological imaging modalities, including ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, and optical coherence tomography angiography, are available. These sensitive modalities allow for a more thorough examination of the retinal periphery where sickle cell retinopathy is often present. Utilization of such modalities will help with the early detection of the disease in children, which provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and guide future screening and treatment regimens. © The Author(s), 2021.",,0.0,SAGE Publications Ltd,English,Review,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
100,Evaluation of retinal nerve fiber layer and choroidal thickness with spectral domain optical coherence tomography in children with sickle cell anemia,2021,Turkish Journal of Pediatrics,"Background. The aim of this study is to examine the thickness of choroidal, macular and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in pediatric patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) without retinopathy. Methods. A total of 75 children (30 SCA patients (Group 1) and 45 healthy individuals (Group 2) were included in the study. Macular (central, superior, inferior, nasal, temporal), choroidal (subfoveal, at nasal distances from the central fovea of 1000 μm [N1], 2000 μm [N2], 3000 μm [N3], at temporal distances from the central fovea of 1000 μm [T1], 2000 μm [T2], 3000 μm [T3]) and RNFL (average, temporal, superotemporal, inferotemporal, nasal, inferonasal and superonasal) measurements were performed by SD-OCT. These parameters were compared with healthy children with similar demographic characteristics. Results. The mean age was 14.11±3.86 (11-18) in sickle cell anemia patients and 13.15± 2.69 (10-18) in the healthy control group. Of the patients, 56.6% (n=17) of Group 1 and 44.4% (n=20) of Group 2 were male. Choroidal measurements made in the subfoveal, N1, N2, N3, T1, T2 and T3 quadrants showed that the choroid was thinner in 6 quadrants in SCA patients compared to the healthy group (p = 0.003, p = 0.039, p = 0.035, p = 0.595, p = 0.006, p = 0.005, p = 0.047, respectively). In RNFL measurements, there was significant thinning in the temporal, inferotemporal, and nasal quadrants of SCA patients compared to the healthy group. Changes in other quadrants were not significant. Conclusions. SD-OCT is a useful imaging method in the diagnosis and screening in patients with SCA without retinopathy. Early diagnosis of retinopathy during subclinical disease will prevent visual loss in these patients. © 2021, Turkish National Pediatric Society.

101,"High Systolic Blood Pressure, Anterior Segment Changes and Visual Impairment Independently Predict Sickle Cell Retinopathy",2021,Hemoglobin,"Sickle cell disease is often complicated by retinopathy, which can be proliferative or non proliferative. Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy potentially leads to blindness. There is a paucity of data on sickle cell disease-related retinopathy from Africa, where the disease is most prevalent. We aimed to determine the clinical, ophthalmic, and laboratory predictors of sickle cell retinopathy in an African population. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 262 participants, aged 13 years and above, with sickle cell disease. Demographic and clinical data were collected using a structured questionnaire and standard physical examinations. Vitreo-retinal specialists performed eye examinations on all the participants. Hematological and biochemical assessments were conducted using standard methods. A multivariate stepwise forward logistic regression was performed to determine the predictors of retinopathy. The median age of the participants was 20 years (interquartile range: 17–25 years). Most of the participants had a homozygous Hb S (HBB: c.20A>T) genotype (96.9%), with 3.1% who carried a Hb S/Hb C (HBB: c.19G>A) genotype. The prevalence of non proliferative sickle cell retinopathy was 24.4%. Only 1.9% had proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (PSCR). Elevated systolic blood pressure (BP) [odds ratio (OR): 6.85, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.05–44.45, p = 0.059], moderate visual impairment (OR: 5.2, 95% CI: 1.39–19.63, p = 0.015), and anterior segment changes (OR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.19–4.13, p = 0.012) were independently predictive of retinopathy.

104,Vitrectomy due to vitreous hemorrhage and tractional retinal detachment secondary to eales’ disease,2021,Turkish Journal of Ophthalmology,"Objectives: To investigate visual and anatomical outcomes of vitreoretinal surgeries in patients with Eales’ disease. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, 22 eyes of 21 patients with vitreous hemorrhage (VH) or tractional retinal detachment (TRD) secondary to Eales’ disease who underwent vitreoretinal surgery between January 1997 and December 2015 and had at least 1 year of follow-up were included. Results: The mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was significantly higher at final visit (0.6±0.9 logMAR) than the preoperative values (1.8±1.1 logMAR) (p<0.001). After surgery, BCVA was stable in 4 eyes (18.2%), increased in 16 eyes (72.7%), and decreased in 2 eyes (9.1%). Although the mean BCVA was better in the VH group (0.3±0.34 logMAR) than the TRD group (0.9±1.1 logMAR), the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.1). Multivariable linear regression analyses revealed that final BCVA was negatively associated with preoperative or postoperative proliferative vitreoretinopathy grade C (PVR-C), preoperative retinal detachment involving the macula, postoperative neovascular glaucoma, and long preoperative duration of disease, and positively associated with preoperative BCVA. Final BCVA was not associated with preoperative retinal and disc neovascularization, rubeosis iridis, total posterior hyaloid detachment, preoperative retinal laser photocoagulation, indication of surgery, diameter of sclerotomy (20 or 23 gauge), preoperative lens status, preoperative or postoperative epimacular membrane, peroperative iatrogenic retinal breaks, postoperative hypotony, cystoid macular edema, and new or recurrent retinal detachment. The primary anatomic success rate was 81.8% and the final anatomic success rate was 90.9%.Conclusion: In Eales’ disease, good visual results can be obtained with vitreoretinal surgery if the detachment area does not involve the macula and PVR-C does not develop pre- or postoperatively. © 2021 by Turkish Ophthalmological Association Turkish Journal of Ophthalmology, published by Galenos Publishing House.","['antibiotic agent', '  bevacizumab', '  corticosteroid', '  perflutren', '  silicone oil', '  sulfur hexafluoride', '  triamcinolone', '  Article', '  Behcet disease', '  best corrected visual acuity', '  chemexfoliation', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  disease duration', '  disease severity', '  drug withdrawal', '  Eales disease', '  epiretinal membrane', '  eye surgery', '  follow up', '  hypertension retinopathy', '  inflammation', '  intraocular hypotension', '  intraocular pressure', '  laser coagulation', '  lens', '  lensectomy', '  medical history', '  neovascular glaucoma', '  operation duration', '  outcome assessment', '  phacoemulsification', '  postoperative care', '  postoperative complication', '  preoperative care', '  preoperative evaluation', '  preoperative period', '  recurrent disease', '  retina detachment', '  retina macula cystoid edema', '  retina vein occlusion', '  retinotomy', '  sarcoidosis', '  sclerotomy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  syphilis', '  vision test', '  visual acuity', '  vitrectomy', '  vitreoretinal surgery', '  vitreoretinopathy', '  vitreous hemorrhage', '  adult', '  aged', '  complication', '  female', '  human', '  male', '  middle aged', '  neovascularization (pathology)', '  procedures', '  retina detachment', '  retina vasculitis', '  retrospective study', '  time factor', '  treatment outcome', '  visual acuity', '  vitrectomy', '  vitreous hemorrhage', '  young adult', '  Adult', '  Aged', '  Female', '  Follow-Up Studies', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Neovascularization', ' Pathologic', '  Retinal Detachment', '  Retinal Vasculitis', '  Retrospective Studies', '  Time Factors', '  Treatment Outcome', '  Visual Acuity', '  Vitrectomy', '  Vitreous Hemorrhage', '  Young Adult']",0.0,Turkish Ophthalmology Society,English,Article,['Turkey'],[],['Turkey'],2014 - 2023,1
105,Central macular thickness in patients with sickle cell disease and no signs of retinopathy: a cross-sectional study of Jordanian patients,2021,Journal of International Medical Research,"Objectives: To measure central macular thickness in Jordanian patients with sickle cell disease who did not have retinopathy and compare the findings with age- and sex-matched controls using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, participants underwent visual acuity testing, slit-lamp bio-microscopy, dilated ophthalmoscopy, and SDOCT imaging to measure central macular thickness. Macular quadrant measurements and thickness difference indexes (TDIs) were compared between groups. Results: Twenty eyes with sickle cell disease and 20 control eyes were enrolled. The median visual acuity in both groups was 20/20. The mean macular thickness was significantly lower in eyes with sickle cell disease than in matched controls (mean difference, 22.15 ± 6.44 µm). Peripheral quadrants were all significantly thinner in eyes with sickle cell disease, especially in superior and temporal quadrants. TDIs were lower in eyes with sickle cell disease than in control eyes. Conclusions: Eyes with sickle cell disease that had no clinical evidence of retinopathy exhibited significantly lower central macular thickness in all quadrants, compared with eyes in age- and sex-matched controls. SDOCT is a non-invasive imaging modality that can detect preclinical changes in eyes with sickle cell disease and can be used to screen and monitor the disease process. © The Author(s) 2021.","['adult', '  age related macular degeneration', '  Article', '  central macular thickness', '  clinical article', '  clinical feature', '  controlled study', '  cross-sectional study', '  dilated ophthalmoscopy', '  female', '  human', '  Jordan', '  male', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  patient', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  slit lamp microscopy', '  spectral domain optical coherence tomography', '  visual acuity', '  diagnostic imaging', '  optical coherence tomography', '  prospective study', '  retina disease', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Cross-Sectional Studies', '  Humans', '  Prospective Studies', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence']",1.0,SAGE Publications Ltd,English,Article,['Jordan'],[],['Jordan'],2014 - 2023,1
106,Optical coherence tomography-angiography in pediatric ophthalmological practice (review),2021,Oftalmologiya,"Data from sources of domestic and foreign literature for 2016-2019 is presented in the review of literature. This data concerned of applying the method of optical coherent tomography-angiography in pediatric ophthalmic practice. OCT-A is a non-invasive research method, without the use of fluorescent dyes. The procedure is performed relatively quickly, with the possibility of additional repetition. The method allows to conduct visualization of the vascular network of the retina layer-by-layer, perform its quantitative analysis: To evaluate the density of the microvascular bed and measure the area of non-perfusion zones. Having appeared as a result of a qualitative modernization of OCT, a new method of visualization of vessels OCT-A is actively used in the diagnosis of pathologies such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, post-thrombotic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, central serous chorioretinopathy, etc. In present time OCT-A being performed in adult medicine, it is actively used in various areas of pediatric ophthalmology. Presently, pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus, sickle cell anemia, amblyopia, retinal artery occlusion, and coats disease have been performed with OCT-A studies. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is required a special attention among children's eye diseases. However, mentioning about OCT angiographic studies in patients with ROP are quite rare in the literature. Nevertheless, the available data indicate the enormous diagnostic potential of OCT-A in this severe vasoproliferative disease. The method give possibility for fully control the pathological process, to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment and timely prevent the development of severe stages of ROP. Due to the information and diagnostic potential, it is necessary to continue research on the possibilities of the OCT-A method in the diagnosis, analysis of treatment results and prediction of ROP. © 2021 Ophthalmology Publishing Group.

108,Visual cortex changes in children with sickle cell disease and normal visual acuity: a multimodal magnetic resonance imaging study,2021,British Journal of Haematology,"The visual system is primarily affected in sickle cell disease (SCD), and eye examination is recommended starting in late childhood. So far, to our knowledge, all studies have focused on the retina, neglecting the changes that might be present in the cortical portion of the visual system. We performed a multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation of the visual cortex in 25 children with SCD (mean age: 12·3 ± 1·9 years) and 31 controls (mean age: 12·7 ± 1·6 years). At ophthalmologic examination, 3/25 SCD children had mild visual acuity deficits and 2/25 had mild tortuosity of the retinal vessels. None showed optic pathway infarcts at MRI or Transcranial Doppler abnormal blood velocities, and 6/25 disclosed posterior cerebral artery stenosis (five mild and one severe) at MR-angiography. Compared to controls, SCD children had increased posterior pericalcarine cortical thickness, with a different trajectory of cortical maturation and decreased connectivity within medial and ventral visual neural networks. Our findings suggest that SCD affects the development and the tuning of the visual cortex, leading to anatomical and functional changes in childhood even in the absence of retinopathy, and set the basis for future studies to determine if these changes can represent useful predictors of visual impairment in adulthood, biomarkers of disease progression or treatment response. © 2020 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","['adolescent', '  Article', '  cerebral artery disease', '  child', '  controlled study', '  cortical thickness (brain)', '  disease association', '  disease course', '  eye examination', '  female', '  human', '  magnetic resonance angiography', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  medial visual neural network', '  nerve cell network', '  nuclear magnetic resonance imaging', '  population research', '  posterior cerebral artery stenosis', '  posterior pericalcarine cortical thickness', '  priority journal', '  sickle cell anemia', '  transcranial Doppler ultrasonography', '  ventral visual neural network', '  visual acuity', '  visual cortex', '  brain', '  complication', '  diagnostic imaging', '  nuclear magnetic resonance imaging', '  pathology', '  sickle cell anemia', '  visual cortex', '  visual system', '  Adolescent', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Brain', '  Child', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Magnetic Resonance Imaging', '  Male', '  Nerve Net', '  Visual Cortex', '  Visual Pathways']",3.0,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,English,Article,['Italy'],[Fondazione Città],['Italy'],2014 - 2023,1
109,Ocular Manifestations of Sickle Cell Disease in Different Genotypes,2021,Ophthalmic Epidemiology,"Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a multisystemic disorder with variable systemic involvement which varies according to genotype. In this study, our aim is to compare ocular complications between HbSS, HbSC, HbS/β+ thalassemia, HbS/β0 thalassemia, SS alpha thalassemia, and S/β0 + alpha thalassemia genotypes. Methods: Data of patients included in this study was recruited from the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD). Patients with major sickle cell hemoglobinopathies (SS, SC, Sβ- thalassemia, SS alpha thalassemia) were eligible for enrollment, after that, a detailed eye exam was performed. We categorized ocular complications into conjunctival sign, iris atrophy, and both proliferative and non-proliferative sickle cell retinopathy. Results: A total of 1867 patients were included in this study, with a mean age of 27.7 (± 11.7) years. They were 830 (44.5%) males and 1037 (55.5%) females. The most common genotype was SS with 971 (52%) patients, and the least common form was sickle cell with both alpha and beta thalassemia major with 42 (2.2%) patients. We found a significant difference in the frequency of proliferative sickle cell retinopathy, where SC genotype had the highest frequency and S B0 thalassemia genotype had the lowest frequency. We also found a significant difference in the frequency of conjunctival sign, where SS genotype had the highest frequency and the S B+ thalassemia has the lowest frequency. Conclusion: We identified ocular complications for major sickle cell hemoglobinopathies, where we confirmed previous small study’s findings and identified ocular complications of less common hemoglobinopathies. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","['hemoglobin', '  hemoglobin S', '  hemoglobin S', '  adult', '  alpha thalassemia', '  Article', '  best corrected visual acuity', '  conjunctiva disease', '  controlled study', '  eye disease', '  female', '  follow up', '  genotype', '  hemoglobin analysis', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  human', '  human tissue', '  iris atrophy', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  priority journal', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  retina detachment', '  retina hemorrhage', '  retina neovascularization', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell beta thalassemia', '  vitreous hemorrhage', '  adolescent', '  complication', '  conjunctiva', '  genetics', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  young adult', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Conjunctiva', '  Female', '  Genotype', '  Hemoglobin', ' Sickle', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Young Adult']",2.0,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,English,Article,['Jordan'],[],['Jordan'],2014 - 2023,1
110,Post intravitreal bevacizumab recurrent Burkholderia cepacia endophthalmitis treated with clear lens extraction in an African,2020,American Journal of Ophthalmology Case Reports,"Purpose: To report the successful treatment of post intravitreal bevacizumab recurrent Burkholderia cepacia endophthalmitis managed with a clear lens extraction and posterior capsulectomy. Observation: A 34-year-old female African, known SC hemoglobinopathy patient, presented with bilateral blur in vision and floaters of a week duration; worse in her right eye. Her visual acuity was right eye 6/9 (20/30) and left eye 6/6 (20/20). Her anterior segment examination was normal in both eyes. On fundus examination, she had a right eye vitreous hemorrhage and bilateral active Sea-fan neovascular proliferation in the retina periphery. Following the administration of bilateral simultaneous intravitreal bevacizumab, she presented 4 days later with a right eye infective endophthalmitis. She suffered multiple recurrences despite adequate treatment, including a vitrectomy with silicone oil injection. Multiple microbiological assessment of intraocular extracts confirmed persistent Burkholderia cepacia infection. A wide ring-shaped opaque plaque was noticed on the posterior capsule of her clear lens. A decision was taken to perform a lensectomy and posterior capsulectomy. This resulted in immediate resolution of hypopyon and all intraocular inflammation. Vision improved from Hand Motion to 6/18 (20/60). Conclusion and importance: This report suggests than in some cases of recurrent, difficult to treat, Burkholderia cepacia endophthalmitis, since the organism may have colonized the posterior lens capsule, the eye and vision can be salvaged by timely removal of a clear lens and capsulectomy. Clear lens removal has not been previously reported for treating recurrent Burkholderia cepacia endophthalmitis. © 2020","['bevacizumab', '  ceftazidime', '  cotrimoxazole', '  dexamethasone', '  eye drops', '  fibrin', '  gatifloxacin', '  homatropine', '  moxifloxacin', '  prednisolone', '  prednisolone acetate', '  silicone oil', '  trimethoprim', '  vancomycin', '  adult', '  antibiotic sensitivity', '  antibiotic therapy', '  Article', '  B scan', '  blurred vision', '  Burkholderia cepacia infection', '  case report', '  clinical article', '  clinical assessment', '  cornea endothelium', '  drug dose reduction', '  endophthalmitis', '  eye examination', '  eye inflammation', '  eye pain', '  eye surgery', '  female', '  fluorescence angiography', '  follow up', '  hemoglobinopathy', '  human', '  hypopyon', '  intraocular pressure', '  laser coagulation', '  lensectomy', '  microbiological examination', '  optical coherence tomography angiography', '  posterior capsulectomy', '  postoperative period', '  proliferative sickle cell retinopathy', '  recurrent disease', '  retina detachment', '  retinopathy', '  steroid therapy', '  topical treatment', '  treatment duration', '  visual acuity', '  vitrectomy', '  vitreous body detachment', '  vitreous floaters', '  vitreous hemorrhage']",0.0,Elsevier Inc.,English,Article,"['Niger', ' Nigeria', ' Zimbabwe']",[],"['Niger', 'Nigeria']",2014 - 2023,3
111,Analysis of the foveal microvasculature in sickle cell disease using swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography,2020,Scientific Reports,"Ischemic microangiopathy was clearly identified in sickle cell disease (SCD) using fluorescein angiography. A prospective observational clinical study was conducted to assess the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area and explore perifoveal microvasculature changes in the superficial (SCP) and deep (DCP) capillary plexus using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and compare two genotypes—HbS/HbS (HbSS) and HbS/HbC (HbSC)-to control. All consecutive patients with electrophoretic confirmation of SCD were included. Swept-source OCTA scans (Triton Plus, Topcon, Tokyo, Japan) with a 3 × 3-mm scanning area and ultra-wide field (UWF) retinography (California, Optos, Fife, Scotland) were recorded for all patients. For OCTA analysis, preset parameters were used to segment the SCP and DCP. The FAZ area was manually assessed. The number of vascular branching points was automatically assessed based on the vascular skeletonization using ImageJ software. Eyes were staged based on Goldberg’s classification of SCD retinopathy (SCDR) using UWF imaging. Forty-six eyes of 24 patients were included in the HbSS (n = 27) and HbSC (n = 19) groups and 16 eyes of 8 unaffected patients in a control group. In the DCP, the FAZ was significantly larger in the HbSC (p = 0.0001) and HbSS (p = 0.0004) groups compared to controls. The FAZ area in the SCP, CRT and number of superficial vascular branching points did not significantly differ between both genotypes. There were less branching points in the HbSC (p = 0.034) and HbSS (p = 0.0014) groups than in controls. The Goldberg stage was significantly higher in the HbSC group than in the HbSS group (2.21 vs. 1.22, p = 0.0062). OCTA provides useful information on macular microvasculature and structural alterations associated with SCDR. Ischemic abnormalities are more predominant in the DCP in case of SCDR and no difference was found between genotypes of patients visually asymptomatic. © 2020, The Author(s).","['adult', '  complication', '  diagnostic imaging', '  female', '  fluorescence angiography', '  human', '  male', '  microvasculature', '  middle aged', '  optical coherence tomography', '  pathology', '  procedures', '  retina disease', '  retina fovea', '  severity of illness index', '  sickle cell anemia', '  vascularization', '  young adult', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Female', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Fovea Centralis', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Microvessels', '  Middle Aged', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Severity of Illness Index', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence', '  Young Adult']",4.0,Nature Research,English,Article,['France'],[],['France'],2014 - 2023,1

114,"Vaso-occlusive crises and costs of sickle cell disease in patients with commercial, Medicaid, and Medicare insurance–the perspective of private and public payers",2020,Journal of Medical Economics,"Aim: To characterize vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) and describe healthcare costs among commercially-insured, Medicaid-insured, and Medicare-insured patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Materials and methods: The IBM Truven Health MarketScan Commercial (2000–2018), Medicaid Analytic eXtract (2008–2014), and Medicare Research Identifiable Files (2012–2016) databases were used to identify patients with ≥2 SCD diagnoses. Study measures were evaluated during a 12-month follow-up period, stratified by annual number of VOCs (i.e. 0, 1, and ≥2). Results: Among 16,092 commercially-insured patients (mean age = 36.7 years), 35.3% had 1+ VOCs. Mean annual total all-cause healthcare costs were $15,747, $27,194, and $64,555 for patients with 0, 1, and 2+ VOCs, respectively. Total all-cause healthcare costs were mainly driven by inpatient (0 VOC = 31.0%, 1 VOC = 53.1%, 2+ VOCs = 65.4%) and SCD-related costs (0 VOC = 56.4%, 1 VOC = 78.4%, 2+ VOCs = 93.9%). Among 18,287 Medicaid-insured patients (mean age = 28.5 years, fee-for-service = 50.2%), 63.9% had 1+ VOCs. Mean annual total all-cause healthcare costs were $16,750, $29,880, and $64,566 for patients with 0, 1, and 2+ VOCs, respectively. Inpatient costs (0 VOC = 37.2%, 1 VOC = 64.3%, 2+ VOCs = 72.9%) and SCD-related costs (0 VOC = 60.9%, 1 VOC = 73.8%, 2+ VOCs = 92.2%) accounted for a significant proportion of total all-cause healthcare costs. Among 15,431 Medicare-insured patients (mean age = 48.2 years), 55.1% had 1+ VOCs. Mean annual total all-cause healthcare costs were $21,877, $29,250, and $58,308 for patients with 0, 1, and ≥2 VOCs, respectively. Total all-cause healthcare costs were mainly driven by inpatient (0 VOC = 47.9%, 1 VOC = 54.9%, 2+ VOCs = 67.5%) and SCD-related costs (0 VOC = 74.9%, 1 VOC = 84.4%, 2+ VOCs = 95.3%). Limitations: VOCs managed at home were not captured. Analyses were descriptive in an observational setting; thus, no causal relationships can be inferred. Conclusions: A high proportion of patients experienced VOCs across payers. Furthermore, inpatient and SCD-related costs accounted for a significant proportion of total all-cause healthcare costs, which increased with VOC frequency. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","['hydroxyurea', '  opiate', '  acute chest syndrome', '  acute kidney failure', '  adult', '  aged', '  Article', '  asthma', '  avascular necrosis', '  blood transfusion', '  chronic pain', '  deep vein thrombosis', '  female', '  follow up', '  gallbladder disease', '  health care cost', '  health care utilization', '  heart failure', '  human', '  hyperbilirubinemia', '  infection', '  iron overload', '  kidney failure', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  medicaid', '  medicare', '  parasitosis', '  prescription', '  retinopathy', '  seizure', '  septicemia', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell crisis', '  vaso occlusive crises', '  venous thromboembolism', '  economics', '  health care cost', '  health insurance', '  health service', '  medicaid', '  medicare', '  pathophysiology', '  patient attitude', '  sickle cell anemia', '  United States', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Female', '  Health Expenditures', '  Health Services', '  Humans', '  Insurance', ' Health', '  Male', '  Medicaid', '  Medicare', '  Patient Acceptance of Health Care', '  United States']",10.0,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,English,Article,"['Canada', ' India', ' United States']","[Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, NPC]",['Canada'],2014 - 2023,3
115,Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography allow early identification of sickle cell maculopathy in children and correlate it with systemic risk factors,2020,Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology,"Purpose: To determine the presence of sickle cell retinopathy and maculopathy and to identify associations between markers of hemolysis and systemic and ocular manifestations in children affected by sickle cell disease. Methods: Eighteen children with sickle cell disease, aged 5–16 years, underwent complete eye examination including best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy after pharmacological mydriasis, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Blood test results and clinical history information were collected for each child, including fetal hemoglobin (HbF), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Htc), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes percentage (%ret), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), total and direct bilirubin, glomerular filtration rate, number of painful crises, acute chest syndromes, and splenic sequestration. Therapeutic regimen and transfusion therapy were also evaluated. Results: Sixteen of 36 eyes (44.4%) had non-proliferative sickle cell retinopathy on ophthalmoscopic evaluation. No patients had proliferative sickle cell retinopathy. In 13 of 36 eyes (36.1%), SD-OCT and OCTA detected signs of sickle cell maculopathy. Nine eyes (25%) presented sickle cell retinopathy and maculopathy, 7 eyes (19.4%) sickle cell retinopathy alone, and 4 eyes (11.1%) sickle cell maculopathy alone. A statistically significant association was found between sickle cell retinopathy; lower levels of HbF, Hb, and Htc; and higher MCV and percentage of reticulocytes. Sickle cell maculopathy was associated with lower values of H and Htc and higher levels of reticulocytes and total bilirubin. Conclusions: We identified early signs of sickle cell retinopathy and maculopathy in a pediatric population with SD-OCT and OCTA. These two retinal complications were more frequent in children with higher hemolytic rates. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","['bilirubin glucuronide', '  hemoglobin F', '  hydroxyurea', '  lactate dehydrogenase', '  acute chest syndrome', '  adolescent', '  Article', '  autofluorescence imaging', '  best corrected visual acuity', '  blood transfusion', '  child', '  clinical article', '  controlled study', '  correlational study', '  cross-sectional study', '  eye examination', '  eye fundus', '  female', '  glomerulus filtration rate', '  hematocrit', '  human', '  male', '  mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration', '  mean corpuscular volume', '  medical history', '  mydriasis', '  observational study', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  optical coherence tomography angiography', '  priority journal', '  reticulocyte', '  retina maculopathy', '  retinopathy', '  risk factor', '  sickle cell anemia', '  slit lamp microscopy', '  spectral domain optical coherence tomography', '  complication', '  fluorescence angiography', '  macular degeneration', '  optical coherence tomography', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  visual acuity', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Child', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Humans', '  Macular Degeneration', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Risk Factors', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence', '  Visual Acuity']",5.0,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,English,Article,['Italy'],[],['Italy'],2014 - 2023,1

117,Peripartum hyperhemolysis prophylaxis and management in sickle cell disease: A case report and narrative review,2020,Transfusion,"Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with hematologic complications including delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) and pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality. Hyperhemolysis syndrome (HS) is the most severe form of DHTR in patients with SCD, in which both transfused and native red blood cells are destroyed. Further transfusions are avoided after a history of HS. Immunosuppressive agents can be used as prophylaxis against life-threatening hemolysis when transfusion is necessary. There is a paucity of evidence for the use of HS prophylaxis before transfusions, the continuation of hydroxyurea (HU) in lieu of chronic transfusion, and the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) in pregnant SCD patients. Case Report: We present a case of a pregnant patient with SCD and a previous history of HS. HS prophylaxis was given before transfusion with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab. In addition, HU was continued during pregnancy to control SCD, along with the use of concomitant ESA to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels and avoid transfusion. We describe a multidisciplinary approach to pregnancy and delivery management including tailored anesthetic and obstetric planning. Conclusion: This is the first published case of HS prophylaxis in a pregnant SCD patient, with good maternal and fetal outcomes after transfusion. HU and ESAs were able to control SCD and mitigate anemia in lieu of prophylactic transfusions during pregnancy. Further prospective studies are necessary to elucidate the ideal management of pregnant SCD patients with a history of HS or other contraindications to chronic transfusion. © 2020 AABB","['corticosteroid', '  cyanocobalamin', '  eculizumab', '  hydroxyurea', '  immunoglobulin', '  infusion fluid', '  iron', '  meprednisone', '  recombinant erythropoietin', '  rituximab', '  corticosteroid', '  immunoglobulin', '  rituximab', '  acute chest syndrome', '  adult', '  Article', '  artificial ventilation', '  B12 deficiency', '  blood transfusion reaction', '  case report', '  cerebrovascular accident', '  clinical article', '  drug substitution', '  drug withdrawal', '  endotracheal intubation', '  erythrocyte transfusion', '  female', '  fetus outcome', '  food poisoning', '  health care delivery', '  hospital admission', '  hospital discharge', '  human', '  intensive care unit', '  intrauterine growth retardation', '  medical history', '  pain', '  patient care', '  perinatal period', '  postoperative hemorrhage', '  pregnancy outcome', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  spontaneous abortion', '  tachycardia', '  uterine atony', '  visual impairment', '  blood', '  blood transfusion reaction', '  drug effect', '  hemolysis', '  perinatal period', '  pregnancy', '  pregnancy complication', '  sickle cell anemia', '  syndrome', '  Adrenal Cortex Hormones', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Female', '  Hemolysis', '  Humans', '  Immunoglobulins', ' Intravenous', '  Peripartum Period', '  Pregnancy', '  Pregnancy Complications', ' Hematologic', '  Rituximab', '  Syndrome', '  Transfusion Reaction']",1.0,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,English,Article,['Canada'],[],['Canada'],2014 - 2023,1
118,Polymorphisms in Inflammatory Genes Modulate Clinical Complications in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease,2020,Frontiers in Immunology,"Sickle cell disease (SCD), the most common monogenic disease worldwide, is marked by a phenotypic variability that is, to date, only partially understood. Because inflammation plays a major role in SCD pathophysiology, we hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in genes encoding functionally important inflammatory proteins might modulate the occurrence of SCD complications. We assessed the association between 20 SNPs in genes encoding Toll-like receptors (TLR), NK cell receptors (NKG), histocompatibility leukocyte antigens (HLA), major histocompatibility complex class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), and the occurrence of six SCD clinical complications (stroke, acute chest syndrome (ACS), leg ulcers, cholelithiasis, osteonecrosis, or retinopathy). This study was performed in a cohort of 500 patients. We found that the TLR2 rs4696480 TA, TLR2 rs3804099 CC, and HLA-G, rs9380142 AA genotypes were more frequent in patients who had fewer complications. Also, in logistic regression, the HLA-G rs9380142 G allele increased the risk of cholelithiasis (AG vs. AA, OR 1.57, 95%CI 1.16–2.15; GG vs. AA, OR 2.47, 95%CI 1.34–4.64; P = 0.02). For SNPs located in the NKG2D loci, in logistic regression, the A allele in three SNPs was associated with a lower frequency of retinopathy, namely, rs2246809 (AA vs. GG: OR 0.22, 95%CI 0.09–0.50; AG vs. GG: OR 0.47, 95%CI 0.31–0.71; P = 0.004, for patients of same origin), rs2617160 (AT vs. TT: OR 0.67, 95%CI 0.48–0.92; AA vs. TT: OR 0.45, 95%CI 0.23–0.84; P = 0.04), and rs2617169 (AA vs. TT: OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.13–0.82; AT vs. TT: OR 0.58, 95%CI 0.36–0.91, P = 0.049, in patients of same SCD genotype). These results, by uncovering susceptibility to, or protection against SCD complications, might contribute to a better understanding of the inflammatory pathways involved in SCD manifestations and to pave the way for the discovery of biomarkers that predict disease severity, which would improve SCD management. © Copyright © 2020 Tozatto-Maio, Girot, Ly, Silva Pinto, Rocha, Fernandes, Diagne, Benzerara, Dinardo, Soler, Kashima, Araujo, Kenzey, Fonseca, Rodrigues, Volt, Jarduli, Ruggeri, Mariaselvam, Gualandro, Rafii, Cappelli, Nogueira, Scigliuolo, Guerino-Cunha, Malmegrim, Simões, Gluckman and Tamouza.","['acetylsalicylic acid', '  clopidogrel', '  toll like receptor 1', '  toll like receptor 2', '  toll like receptor 6', '  HLA antigen', '  KLRK1 protein', ' human', '  natural killer cell lectin like receptor subfamily K', '  toll like receptor', '  acute chest syndrome', '  adult', '  aged', '  allele', '  Article', '  bone necrosis', '  case control study', '  cerebrovascular accident', '  cholelithiasis', '  controlled study', '  disease severity', '  dual antiplatelet therapy', '  echography', '  female', '  follow up', '  gene', '  gene frequency', '  genetic polymorphism', '  genetic variability', '  genotype', '  haplotype', '  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '  high performance liquid chromatography', '  HLA system', '  human', '  leg ulcer', '  lymphocyte', '  major clinical study', '  major histocompatibility complex', '  male', '  natural killer cell', '  nuclear magnetic resonance imaging', '  pathophysiology', '  polymerase chain reaction', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  Rankin scale', '  real time polymerase chain reaction', '  retrospective study', '  sickle cell anemia', '  single nucleotide polymorphism', '  thorax radiography', '  tissue regeneration', '  adolescent', '  allele', '  child', '  complication', '  genetic predisposition', '  genetics', '  immunology', '  infant', '  middle aged', '  newborn', '  preschool child', '  sickle cell anemia', '  young adult', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Aged', '  Alleles', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Case-Control Studies', '  Child', '  Child', ' Preschool', '  Female', '  Gene Frequency', '  Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '  Genotype', '  Haplotypes', '  HLA Antigens', '  Humans', '  Infant', '  Infant', ' Newborn', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K', '  Polymorphism', ' Single Nucleotide', '  Toll-Like Receptors', '  Young Adult']",7.0,Frontiers Media S.A.,English,Article,"['Brazil', ' France', ' Italy', ' Monaco', ' Senegal']","[de Pessoal de N&#x00ED;vel Superior, CAPES]","['Brazil', 'France', 'Monaco']",2014 - 2023,5

Various methods have been introduced to determine several diseases out of which the concept of measurement of endothelins and matrix metalloproteinases and the usage of endothelin receptor antagonist as a way of treatment either singly or combinedly with other drugs has achieved more importance. By the usage of serum matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and endothelins we can determine the people who are at risk of developing hypertension, type2 diabetes, heart failure, atherosclerosis, cancer, pulmonary hypertension and can also assess the range of complications that are going to occur in the individual. These elevated levels cause remodelling after a period of time. Hence, the detection is done through a method in which few factors like endothelins and MMPs of our body are measured through a blood sample, maximum benefits can be obtained in individuals who have a significant family history of developing hypertension and other conditions In this review we have discussed about various effects of endothelins in different conditions, and also to know if these conditions can be improved or not by using endothelin receptor antagonists. © International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.","['amino acid', '  angiotensin II', '  colony stimulating factor', '  cytokine', '  endothelial cell growth factor', '  endothelin', '  endothelin converting enzyme', '  lipoprotein lipase', '  matrix metalloproteinase', '  nitric oxide', '  reactive oxygen metabolite', '  thrombin', '  vasoconstrictor agent', '  vasopressin', '  airway obstruction', '  Alzheimer disease', '  antineoplastic activity', '  Article', '  asthma', '  atherosclerosis', '  bone metabolism', '  bronchoconstriction', '  cardiovascular disease', '  cell adhesion', '  chronic kidney failure', '  chronic pain', '  diabetes mellitus', '  disease exacerbation', '  drug efficacy', '  drug synthesis', '  edema', '  embryo development', '  global disease burden', '  heart failure', '  heart infarction', '  human', '  hypertension', '  indirect ELISA', '  low income country', '  malignant neoplasm', '  metastasis', '  morphogenesis', '  neuropathy', '  prevalence', '  proteinuria', '  pulmonary hypertension', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  vascular endothelial cell', '  vascular endothelium', '  wound healing']",0.0,J.

126,"Ocular Manifestations of Sickle Cell Disease: Signs, Symptoms and Complications",2020,Ophthalmic Epidemiology,"Background: Sickle cell disease is an inherited hematological disorder that can affect any organ in the body including the eyes (1–6). Previous studies on ocular manifestations of sickle cell disease generally included samples of less than 100 patients. In this study, we aim to assess the frequency of different ocular signs, symptoms and complications among sickle cell disease patients. Methods: This study was conducted using data from the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD). Patients with major sickle cell hemoglobinopathies (SS, SC, S β-thal) were eligible for enrollment. Patients from all age groups were included. Patients underwent detailed ophthalmological examination under standardized conditions. Results: A total of 1904 patients were included in this study, with a mean age of 27.67 (±11.72) years. 1,802 (96.4%) patients had BCVA of more than 20/40 in the better-seeing eye. On slit lamp examination, the presence of vascular loops and segment, representing a positive conjunctival sign, was the most common reported abnormal finding (54.1%). The most common complication was peripheral retinal artery occlusion detected in225 patients (20.3%) bilaterally and 77 patients (6.9%) unilaterally. Conclusion: In this study that included one of the largest samples ever studied to assess ocular complications of sickle cell disease, we identified the frequency and percentages of different ocular signs, symptoms and complications in different age groups. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","['adult', '  angioid streak', '  Article', '  blurred vision', '  central retina vein occlusion', '  diplopia', '  eye examination', '  eye pain', '  female', '  human', '  intraocular hemorrhage', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  optic disk anomaly', '  priority journal', '  retina artery occlusion', '  retina blood vessel occlusion', '  retina hemorrhage', '  retina macula hole', '  retina tear', '  sickle cell anemia', '  slit lamp microscopy', '  visual impairment', '  adolescent', '  African American', '  case control study', '  complication', '  conjunctiva', '  diagnostic imaging', '  ethnology', '  eye disease', '  physiology', '  prospective study', '  retina artery occlusion', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  vision', '  visual acuity', '  visual system examination', '  young adult', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  African Americans', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Case-Control Studies', '  Conjunctiva', '  Diagnostic Techniques', ' Ophthalmological', '  Eye Diseases', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Prospective Studies', '  Retinal Artery Occlusion', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Vision', ' Ocular', '  Visual Acuity', '  Young Adult']",7.0,Taylor and Francis Ltd,English,Article,"['Jordan', ' Qatar']",[],['Jordan'],2014 - 2023,2

Methods: This cross-sectional, retrospective study evaluated SCR patients and unaffected controls who underwent 3×3mm macular OCT-A imaging using a spectral domain-OCT system. FAZ (area, perimeter, and acircularity index) and parafoveal capillary density metrics were computed for both eyes of each participant. In unaffected controls, interocular difference in FAZ and parafoveal capillary density metrics were evaluated using Bland-Altman plots. SCR patients with interocular difference outside the upper 97.5% and lower 2.5% limits of agreement from controls were defined as having interocular asymmetry. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC) was also performed to determine the ability of the absolute interocular difference to differentiate between subjects with SCR-including nonproliferative SCR (NP-SCR) and proliferative SCR (P-SCR)-and unaffected controls. Results: Thirty-one patients with SCR (21 NP-SCR and 10 P-SCR) and 14 race-matched and agematched controls were included for analysis. Interocular asymmetry was seen for all FAZ and parafoveal capillary density metrics in NP-SCR and P-SCR subjects. SCR subjects showed greater disease severity in the left-eye for FAZ and parafoveal capillary density metrics. Conclusions: NP-SCR and P-SCR patients demonstrated quantifiable interocular asymmetry in FAZ and parafoveal capillary density metrics compared to unaffected subjects, with left-eye predominance in disease severity. © 2020 Zhou et al.","['adult', '  African American', '  Article', '  best corrected visual acuity', '  capillary density', '  clinical article', '  controlled study', '  cross-sectional study', '  disease severity', '  eye examination', '  female', '  foveal avascular zone', '  human', '  image analysis', '  image processing', '  image quality', '  male', '  optical coherence tomography angiography', '  perimetry', '  receiver operating characteristic', '  retinopathy', '  retrospective study', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  visual system parameters', '  area under the curve', '  capillary', '  case control study', '  complication', '  diagnostic imaging', '  eye', '  middle aged', '  optical coherence tomography', '  pathology', '  physiology', '  retina disease', '  retina fovea', '  severity of illness index', '  sickle cell anemia', '  vascularization', '  young adult', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Area Under Curve', '  Capillaries', '  Case-Control Studies', '  Cross-Sectional Studies', '  Eye', '  Female', '  Fovea Centralis', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retrospective Studies', '  ROC Curve', '  Severity of Illness Index', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence', '  Young Adult']",1.0,Public Library of Science,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Institutes of Health, NIH, National Eye Institute, R01EY024969, Marrus Family Foundation]",['United States'],2014 - 2023,1

130,Relating retinal blood flow and vessel morphology in sickle cell retinopathy,2020,"Eye (London, England)","PURPOSE: The purpose of the current study was to determine associations between retinal blood flow and vessel morphology metrics in sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) and healthy normal control (NC) subjects. METHODS: Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and Doppler OCT imaging were performed in 12 SCR (15 eyes) and 19 NC (26 eyes) subjects. Vessel tortuosity was measured using a dedicated image analysis algorithm applied to OCTA images. Vessel density and spacing between vessels were determined from OCTA images by a fractal dimension analysis method. Retinal blood flow was quantified using a phase-resolved technique applied to en face Doppler OCT images. RESULTS: There was a significant association between increased retinal blood flow and increased vessel tortuosity (P = 0.03). Furthermore, increased retinal blood flow was associated with increased vessel density (P = 0.03) and decreased spacing between small vessels (P = 0.01). There was no significant association between retinal blood flow and spacing between large vessels (P = 0.11). Vessel tortuosity and blood flow were increased, whereas spacing between small vessels was decreased in SCR compared to NC group (P ≤ 0.03). There were no significant differences in vessel density or spacing between large vessels between the SCR and NC groups (P ≥ 0.31). CONCLUSIONS: Associations between retinal hemodynamics and vessel morphology were reported, providing better understanding of retinal pathophysiology and insight into potential quantitative biomarkers to evaluate SCR.","['diagnostic imaging', '  fluorescence angiography', '  hemodynamics', '  human', '  optical coherence tomography', '  retina blood vessel', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Hemodynamics', '  Humans', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retinal Vessels', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence']",8.0,NLM (Medline),English,Article,['United States'],[National Eye Institute],[],2014 - 2023,1
131,Sickle cell retinopathy in children: Report of 42 cases [La rétinopathie drépanocytaire chez l'enfant : à propos de 42 cas],2020,Journal Francais d'Ophtalmologie,"We aimed to describe the epidemiological, etiological and clinical features, treatment and clinical course of sickle cell retinopathy in children and to determine the risk factors for serious involvement. Methods: This was a retrospective study including all children diagnosed with sickle cell retinopathy. Epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic characteristics, as well as clinical course, were analysed retrospectively by chart review. Two groups were defined: Group 1 (Goldberg stage 1 and 2); Group 2 (Goldberg stage 3, 4 and 5). In order to identify factors independently associated with severe sickle cell retinopathy, we conducted a logistic regression analysis in descending order. Results: The frequency of sickle cell retinopathy was 14.48%. Forty-two patients (84 eyes) were included; among them 23 boys and 19 girls, aged 10 to 17 with a mean age of 14 ± 1.98 years. Twenty patients were of genotype SS, 11 patients of genotype SC, 8 Sβ and 3 SO Arab. The three patients in group 2 were all of SS genotype. The majority of patients (32) had an HbF level of less than 15%. All our patients had sickle cell retinopathy distributed as follows: 62% at stage 1; 31% at stage 2; 5% at stage 3 and 2% at stage 4. Multivariate analysis revealed a single risk factor independently linked to severe involvement – an HbF level < 15%. Conclusion: Retinopathy is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease which may lead to blindness.

132,Foveal avascular zone morphology and parafoveal capillary perfusion in sickle cell retinopathy,2020,British Journal of Ophthalmology,"Background/aims To assess foveal avascular zone (FAZ) morphology and parafoveal capillary perfusion in patients with various stages of sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A). Methods This is a multi-institutional retrospective study of patients with various stages of SCR compared with healthy controls. Parafoveal OCT-A images obtained using a commercial spectral domain-OCT system were reviewed. Foveal-centred 3×3 mm full vascular slab OCT-As were used for image processing and data analysis. FAZ area, perimeter, and acircularity index were determined on the OCT-A image after manual delineation of the FAZ border. Quadrant-based parafoveal capillary density and per cent area deviating from normal distribution were also measured. Results Fifty-two patients with SCR (33 non-proliferative and 19 proliferative) and 20 age and race-matched healthy controls were included. One randomly selected eye per study participant was analysed. FAZ perimeter and acircularity index were significantly greater in SCR eyes when compared with the controls. While parafoveal capillary density was significantly lower, per cent area deviated from normal distribution was significantly higher in SCR eyes than that of the control. However, no statistically significant difference between the two SCR stages was observed. In quadrant-based analysis, the temporal quadrant showed greater parafoveal capillary dropout due to SCR, with the most profound effect in patients with proliferative SCR. Conclusions Abnormal FAZ morphology and altered parafoveal capillary perfusion were found in patients with SCR. Our customised OCT-A image analysis method uniquely highlights significant quantitative alterations in perfusion density mapping in a qualitative display, with minimal obscuration of OCT-A image detail. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

133,Sickle cell retinopathy: Characterization among patients over 40 years of age,2020,Revista Brasileira de Oftalmologia,"Purpose: This article aims to describe the prevalence of retinal alterations on the indirect binocular ophthalmoscopy exam in patients with sickle cell disease (HbSS or HbSC) who are over 40 years of age. Methods: This is a retrospective study in which patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) with an age group of 40 years or older were attended in a service of retina in Salvador, Brasil on the last 10 years. All patients were submitted to the clinical file filling, which includes the sociodemographic profile, clinical profile and ophthalmologic examination. The patients were divided in two groups (SS or SC), according to genotypic profile of hemoglobinopathy (HbSS or HbSC). The classification of retinopathy was performed according to Goldberg in proliferative and non-proliferative retinopathy. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 97 patients (194 eyes) were evaluated, being 44 (45%) of the SC group and 53 (55%) of the SS group. Of the 97 patients, 19 (19.5%) did not present retinal changes and 78 (80,5%) present sickle cell retinopathy. Of the 78 patients with retinopathy, 22 (28%) had nonproliferative sickle retinopathy and 56 (72%) had proliferative alterations. The increase in vascular tortuosity was the most observed nonproliferative sign (26.8% of eyes) in both groups. The SC patients presented a greater proportion of findings of areas of retinal non perfusion (30%) than SS patients (p = 0.015). Conclusion: The results suggest the need for regular ophthalmologic follow-up of patients with SCD, especially in the older age group, due to the high prevalence of 80.5% of findings of sickle cell retinopathy on examination in patients over 40 years old. © 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Oftalmologia.",,0.0,Sociedade Brasileira de Oftalmologia,English,Article,['Brazil'],[],['Brazil'],2014 - 2023,1
134,Quantifying areas of vascular leakage in sickle cell retinopathy using standard and widefield fluorescein angiography,2020,Ophthalmic Surgery Lasers and Imaging Retina,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate neovascular surface area change in sickle cell retinopathy following scatter photocoagulation treatment in wide- and standard-field fluorescein angiography (FA) scans using ImageJ software. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Images of 11 patients with wide- or standard-field FA scans pre- and post-treatment for sickle cell retinopathy were evaluated retrospectively by two graders using ImageJ. Graders traced lesions in the late arteriovenous phase and calculated the lesion area and intensity relative to the optic disc. Changes in area and intensity preto post-treatment were assessed using dependent t-tests. RESULTS: Pre- to post-treatment, lesion area decreased by 3.34 ± 2.43 to 3.66 ± 3.72 disc areas (P < .001), whereas intensity decreased by 11.36 ± 25.87 to 22.97 ± 69.25 units (P = .104). Neovascular area declined status post-aphotocoagulation by 3.83 ± 3.65 disc areas (P = .003) for widefield images and by 2.81 ± 3.55 discs areas (P = .034) for standard fluorescein images. No statistical difference in area reduction was appreciated between imaging modalities (P = .652) CONCLUSION: Neovascular area decreased significantly following scatter photocoagulation in both standard-field and widefield FA scans without an appreciable difference between imaging modalities.

135,Outcome of vitrectomy for advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy complicating primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment among Nigerians,2020,Nigerian Journal of Clinical Practice,"Aim: To present the anatomical and visual outcome and compare different techniques in the surgical treatment of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) in Nigerians.Method: Comparative retrospective review of PVR grade C and D eyes that had vitreoretinal surgery with silicone oil between April 2005 and December 2012. Data was extracted from consecutive case notes after exclusion of eyes with PVR associated with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (PSCR) and eyes with nonuse of silicone oil. A comparison of the outcome of vitrectomy alone (Vit.), versus combined with a scleral buckle (Vit.+SB), versus with retinectomy (Vit.+RT), versus with all three procedures (Vit.+SB+RT) was done. Statistical analysis was done using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 16 software. Pearson Chi-square test and Fisher's exact T-Test were used to determine the effect of relationships. Results: 138 eyes of 138 patients had grades C (100 eyes) and grade D (38 eyes) PVR. Surgery involved vitrectomy and membrane peel in 53% of eyes, additional scleral buckle in 22%, and retinectomy was performed in 17%. Retinal reattachment rate was 86% for PVR C eyes and 87% in PVR D eyes. There was no statistically significant difference in anatomical outcome between vitrectomy alone and the combination surgeries. In the vitrectomy only category, the postoperative vision was noted to improve (> preoperative), in 48% of PVR C and in 31% of PVR D. 33% of PVR C and 44% of PVR D eyes had a worse vision (< preoperative). Visual outcome was similarly poor in the combination surgeries with improved vision noted in 12%, 44%, and 33% of the Vit.+SB, Vit. +RT, and Vit.+SB+RT PVR C eyes, respectively. In PVR D eyes, improved vision was seen in 57% and 12% of Vit.+SB and Vit.+RT eyes, respectively. Conclusion: Surgery results in anatomical reattachment and there is nonsuperiority of any technique. Visual outcome is poor as previously reported. Recent trials of pharmacological adjuncts may show promise for improved visual outcomes. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

136,Evaluation of Ocular Complications by Using Optical Coherence Tomography in Children with Sickle Cell Disease Eye Findings in Children with Sickle Cell Disease,2020,Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology,"Objective:The aim of this study was to compare optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and healthy individuals and to investigate associations between these data and the patients' systemic findings.Materials and Methods:The study included 108 eyes of 54 patients with SCD with no visual symptoms and a control group consisting of 110 eyes of 55 healthy subjects with no systemic or ocular pathology. After best-corrected visual acuity assessment, the study participants underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination including intraocular pressure. After examination and pupil dilation induced with 1% tropicamide, 9×9 mm macular sections were obtained with spectral-domain OCT. The macular sections were evaluated according to Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) map and internal and external retinal thicknesses were measured using the software included in the OCT device.Results:The patient group showed significantly more foveal flattening, temporal thinning, and vascular tortuosity than the control group (P<0.0001 for all). Foveal width was significantly greater in the patient group (1592.39±175.56 μm) compared with the control group (1391.01±175.56 μm) (P<0.0001), whereas foveal depth was significantly lower in the patient group (121.15±26.83 μm) than in the control group (146.1±12.25 μm) (P<0.0001). The mean total retinal thickness was 253.53±22.31 μm in the patient group and 261.03±18.48 μm in the control group (P=0.007). Similarly, central retinal thickness was significantly lower in the patient group (219.35±10.53 μm) compared with the control group (235.32±12.51 μm) (P<0.0001).Discussion:Our study shows that pediatric patients with SCD may have subclinical retinal involvement and that temporal thinning, in particular, is an important OCT finding. This strongly suggests that OCT imaging would be a beneficial addition to routine ophthalmologic examination in the diagnosis and follow-up of this patient group. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

137,Quantitative optical coherence tomography angiography: A review,2020,Experimental Biology and Medicine,"As a new optical coherence tomography (OCT) modality, OCT angiography (OCTA) provides a noninvasive method to detect microvascular distortions correlated with eye conditions. By providing unparalleled capability to differentiate individual plexus layers in the retina, OCTA has demonstrated its excellence in clinical management of diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, sickle cell retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and other eye diseases. Quantitative OCTA analysis of retinal and choroidal vasculatures is essential to standardize objective interpretations of clinical outcome. Quantitative features, including blood vessel tortuosity, blood vessel caliber, blood vessel density, vessel perimeter index, fovea avascular zone area, fovea avascular zone contour irregularity, vessel branching coefficient, vessel branching angle, branching width ratio, and choroidal vascular analysis have been established for objective OCTA assessment. Moreover, differential artery–vein analysis has been recently demonstrated to improve OCTA performance for objective detection and classification of eye diseases. In this review, technical rationales and clinical applications of these quantitative OCTA features are summarized, and future prospects for using these quantitative OCTA features for artificial intelligence classification of eye conditions are discussed. Impact statement: OCT angiography (OCTA) provides a noninvasive method to detect microvascular distortions correlated with eye conditions. Quantitative analysis of OCTA is essential to standardize objective interpretations of clinical outcome.

138,Data on the role of miR-144 in regulating fetal hemoglobin production in retinal pigmented epithelial cells,2020,Data in Brief,"The data presented in this article are connected to our related article entitled “Inhibiting microRNA-144 potentiates Nrf2-dependent antioxidant signaling in retinal pigmented epithelial cells (RPE) and protects against oxidative stress-induced outer retinal degeneration” [1] where, we have shown that miR-144 induces oxidative stress in RPE cells by targeting Nrf2 expression. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that like erythroid cells, RPE cells express α, β and γ-globin and produce hemoglobin locally in retina. Further, the ability to therapeutically reactivate fetal hemoglobin production in these cells, a strategy of high potential benefit in the treatment of complications of sickle cell disease, including retinopathy, is impacted by Nrf2-mediated signaling [2,3]. Studies by others [4,5] provide compelling evidence of a regulatory role for miR-144 and Nrf2 in fetal hemoglobin production in erythroid cells. Our current work confirms this finding in human RPE. We additionally show that miR-144-mediated regulation of fetal hemoglobin production in RPE cells is independent of kruppel like factor 1 (KLF-1). This supports the plausibility that in RPE, hemoglobin, particularly fetal hemoglobin, may be important for functions other than oxygen transport (e.g., antioxidant defense). Indeed, our new data on miR-144 in RPE supports strongly the potential mechanistic between fetal hemoglobin production and the regulation of oxidative stress in this cell type [1]. © 2019 The Authors","['Antioxidants', '  Cell signaling', '  Cells', '  Cytology', '  Eye protection', '  Ophthalmology', '  Oxidative stress', '  Signaling', '  Epithelial cells', '  Erythroid cells', '  Haemoglobins', '  High potential', '  MiRNA', '  Nrf2 signaling', '  Retinal degenerations', '  Sickle cell', '  Sickle cell retinopathy', '  Stress-induced', '  Hemoglobin']",3.0,Elsevier Inc.,English,Data Paper,"['Georgia', ' United States']",[National Eye Institute],['United States'],2014 - 2023,2
139,Development of a severity classification system for sickle cell disease,2020,ClinicoEconomics and Outcomes Research,"Purpose: There is no well-accepted classification system of overall sickle cell disease (SCD) severity. We sought to develop a system that could be tested as a clinical outcome predictor. Patients and Methods: Using validated methodology (RAND/UCLA modified Delphi panel), 10 multi-disciplinary expert clinicians collaboratively developed 180 simplified patient histories and rated each on multiple axes (estimated clinician follow-up frequency, risk of complications or death, quality of life, overall disease severity). Using ratings on overall disease severity, we developed a 3-level severity classification system ranging from Class I (least severe) to Class III (most severe). Results: The system defines patients as Class I who are 8-40 years with no end organ damage, no chronic pain, and <4 unscheduled acute care visits due to vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) in the last year. Patients <8 or >40 years with no end organ damage, no chronic pain, and <2 unscheduled acute care visits are also considered Class I. Patients any age with >5 unscheduled acute care visits and/or with severe damage to bone, retina, heart, lung, kidney, or brain are classified as Class III (except patients >25 years with severe retinopathy, no chronic pain, and 0-1 unscheduled acute care visits, who are considered Class II). Patients not meeting these Class I or III definitions are classified as Class II. Conclusion: This system consolidates patient characteristics into homogenous groups with respect to disease state to support clinical decision-making. The system is consistent with existing literature that increased unscheduled acute care visits and organ damage translate into clinically significant patient morbidity. Studies to further validate this system are planned. © 2020 Shah et al.

142,"Profile, visual presentation and burden of retinal diseases seen in ophthalmic clinics in sub-saharan africa",2020,Clinical Ophthalmology,"Purpose: To determine the burden of retinal diseases and the degree of visual impairment associated with each disease, amongst Nigerians. Patients and Methods: This was a hospital-based multicenter, prospective, cross-sectional, non-comparative study conducted from January to December 2018. Data was obtained from consecutive patients with a retinal diagnosis presenting at the general ophthalmic and specialty retina clinics in four hospitals (three public, and one private teaching eye depart-ment) in Nigeria. Biodata, visual acuity and refraction, intraocular pressure, findings on dilated retinal examination, diagnosis and systemic diseases were noted. Degree of monocular and bilateral visual loss associated with each diagnosed retinal disease was summarized and p value was calculated using chi-square test. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Eight hundred seventy-six of 8614 patients had a retinal diagnosis; establishing a hospital-based retinal disease prevalence of 9.8%. Male:female ratio was 1.1:1. The mean age of study patients was 49.97 (standard deviation 17.64 years). Mean symptom duration was 21.63 months (standard deviation 41.94). The mean intraocular pressure was 13.87 mmHg. Forty-three different retinal diseases were diagnosed. The most common was retinal complications of diabetes, i.e., diabetic retinopathy (DR) alone, diabetic macular edema (DME) alone and a combination of DR and DME, which accounted for 13.7%, 5.6% and 9.3%, respectively (contributed 28.6% of the entire diagnosis). This was followed by retinal detachment (RD), in 219 eyes (15.4%), dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in 124 eyes (8.7%). Nearly half of the eyes were blind or severely visually impaired. Blindness occurred in 34.1% of eyes; severe visual impairment in 8.2% of eyes and 29.7% had normal vision. There were 469 patients who had systemic diseases. The common systemic diseases were hypertension in 169 patients (19.3% of the total number of patients), hypertension and diabetes in 156 patients (18%), and diabetes alone in 98 patients (11.1%). Sickle cell disease was present in 1.5%. Conclusion: There is need to invest in infrastructure, local training and development of systems for early detection and treatment of several retinal diseases in sub-Saharan Africa; DR and DME having the largest burden. Collaborative physician care and management of hypertension and diabetes could significantly reduce the burden of DR and DME. © 2020 Nkanga et al.","['adult', '  Africa south of the Sahara', '  age related macular degeneration', '  aged', '  Article', '  blindness', '  cross-sectional study', '  diabetic macular edema', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  disease association', '  disease burden', '  disease duration', '  disease severity', '  eye refraction', '  female', '  human', '  hypertension', '  intraocular pressure', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  multicenter study', '  prevalence', '  prospective study', '  retina detachment', '  retina disease', '  sex ratio', '  sickle cell anemia', '  visual acuity', '  visual system examination']",5.0,Dove Medical Press Ltd,English,Article,"['Niger', ' Nigeria']",[],"['Niger', 'Nigeria']",2014 - 2023,2

144,Role of OCT-angiography in the management of sickle cell retinopathy [Apports de l'OCT angiographie dans la prise en charge des rétinopathies drépanocytaires],2020,Journal Francais d'Ophtalmologie,"Introduction: Sickle cell retinopathy is the main ophthalmologic complication of sickle cell syndrome. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCT-A) permit demonstration of central retinal involvement. The goal of this study is to determine whether central retinal involvement is predictive of peripheral retinal ischemia. Materials and methods: We carried out a retrospective study of 31 patients with sickle cell disease who underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination. We focused on capillary density of the superficial and deep plexuses and the central avascular surface by OCT-A, and retinal layer thickness by OCT. All of the findings obtained by OCT-A and OCT were classified according to the Goldberg stages on fluorescein angiography. Results: A thinning of the mean and temporal deep plexus capillary layer as well as a loss of the temporal density of the superficial plexus capillaries are significantly higher in the case of proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (P = < 0.05). A significant negative correlation is observed between the mean and temporal density of the superficial (R= −0.31; P = 0.02 and R= −0.43; P = 0.0009) and deep plexus capillaries (R= −0.39; P = 0.003 et R= −0.43; P = 0.0009) and the Goldberg stage in fluorescein angiography. Conclusion: The study of the temporal capillary densities of the superficial and deep plexuses on OCT angiography may prove to be a useful tool for the ophthalmologist in order to diagnose patients at risk for proliferative sickle cell retinopathy. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","['hydroxyurea', '  adolescent', '  adult', '  angioid streak', '  Article', '  best corrected visual acuity', '  capillary density', '  choroid capillary layer', '  clinical article', '  corrected distance visual acuity', '  disease classification', '  disease severity', '  erythrocyte transfusion', '  eye examination', '  female', '  fluorescence angiography', '  genotype', '  homozygote', '  human', '  male', '  multimodal imaging', '  optical coherence tomography angiography', '  physical examination', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  retina capillary', '  retina neovascularization', '  retinal thickness', '  retinopathy', '  retrospective study', '  sickle cell anemia', '  thalassemia', '  capillary', '  cell size', '  complication', '  diagnostic imaging', '  eye fundus', '  fluorescence angiography', '  middle aged', '  optical coherence tomography', '  pathology', '  predictive value', '  procedures', '  prognosis', '  retina blood vessel', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  young adult', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Capillaries', '  Cell Size', '  Female', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Fundus Oculi', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Predictive Value of Tests', '  Prognosis', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retinal Vessels', '  Retrospective Studies', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence', '  Young Adult']",1.0,Elsevier Masson SAS,English; French,Article,['France'],[],['France'],2014 - 2023,1
145,Retinal oximetry and fractal analysis of capillary maps in sickle cell disease patients and matched healthy volunteers,2020,Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology,"Purpose: Fractal analysis can be used to quantitatively analyze the retinal microvasculature and might be a suitable method to quantify retinal capillary changes in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. Retinal oximetry measurements might function as a proxy for the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular diseases. Moreover, hypoxia has an important role in the pathophysiology of diabetic and other retinopathies. However, little is known about the oximetry around the macula in SCD patients. With this study, we explored the feasibility to perform these quantified measurements in SCD patients. Methods: Retinal microvascular and oximetry measurements were performed in eight SCD patients and eight healthy matched controls. Oximetry pictures and non-invasive capillary perfusion maps (nCPM) were obtained by the retinal function imager. Measurements were conducted twice on two different study days. Measured variables included monofractal dimension (Dbox), relative saturation, deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxyHb), and oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb) concentration. Results: No statistically significant differences in vessel density were found in the different annular zones (large vessels, p = 0.66; small vessels, p = 0.66) and anatomical quadrants (large vessels, p = 0.74; small vessels, p = 0.72). Furthermore, no significant between-group differences were found in the other different anatomical quadrants and annular zones around the fovea for relative saturation levels and deoxygenated Hb. However, the oxyHb levels were significantly lower in SCD patients, compared with those in matched controls in the temporal quadrants (p = 0.04; p = 0.02) and the superior nasal quadrant (p = 0.05). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated the feasibility of multispectral imaging to measure retinal changes in oxygenation in both SCD patients and matched volunteers. The results suggest that in SCD patients before any structural microvascular changes in the central retina are present, functional abnormalities can be observed with abnormal oximetry measurements. © 2019, The Author(s).","['hemoglobin', '  oxygen', '  adult', '  Article', '  capillary', '  clinical article', '  controlled study', '  deoxygenation', '  feasibility study', '  female', '  fractal analysis', '  hemoglobin determination', '  human', '  image processing', '  non invasive procedure', '  observational study', '  oximetry', '  oxygenation', '  priority journal', '  retina capillary', '  retina image', '  retinal oximetry', '  sickle cell anemia', '  visual system function', '  adolescent', '  complication', '  male', '  metabolism', '  microvasculature', '  middle aged', '  normal human', '  optical coherence tomography', '  oximetry', '  oxygen consumption', '  pathology', '  pathophysiology', '  physiology', '  procedures', '  retina disease', '  retina macula lutea', '  sickle cell anemia', '  young adult', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Capillaries', '  Female', '  Healthy Volunteers', '  Humans', '  Macula Lutea', '  Male', '  Microvessels', '  Middle Aged', '  Oximetry', '  Oxygen', '  Oxygen Consumption', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence', '  Young Adult']",0.0,Springer,English,Article,['Netherlands'],[Horizon 2020 Framework Programme],['Netherlands'],2014 - 2023,1
146,Wide-field imaging of sickle retinopathy,2019,International Journal of Retina and Vitreous,"Background: Wide-field imaging is a newer retinal imaging technology, capturing up to 200 degrees of the retina in a single photograph. Individuals with sickle cell retinopathy commonly exhibit peripheral retinal ischemia. Patients with proliferative sickle cell retinopathy develop pathologic retinal neovascularization of the peripheral retina which may progress into sight-threatening sequelae of vitreous hemorrhage and/or retinal detachment. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of current and future applications of wide-field retinal imaging for sickle cell retinopathy, and recommend indications for best use. Main body: There are several advantages to wide-field imaging in the clinical management of sickle cell disease patients. Retrospective and prospective studies support the success of wide-field imaging in detecting more sickle cell induced retinal microvascular abnormalities than traditional non-wide-field imaging. Clinicians can easily capture a greater extent of the retinal periphery in a patient's clinical baseline imaging to follow the changes at an earlier point and determine the rate of progression over time. Wide-field imaging minimizes patient and photographer burden, necessitating less photos and technical skill to capture the peripheral retina. Minimizing the number of necessary images can be especially helpful for pediatric patients with sickle cell retinopathy. Wide-field imaging has already been successful in identifying new biomarkers and risk factors for the development of proliferative sickle cell retinopathy. While these advantages should be considered, clinicians need to perform a careful risk-benefit analysis before ordering this test. Although wide-field fluorescein angiography successfully detects additional pathologic abnormalities compared to traditional imaging, a recent research study suggests that peripheral changes differentially detected by wide-field imaging may not change clinical management for most sickle cell patients. Conclusions: While wide-field imaging may not carry a clinically significant direct benefit to all patients, it shows future promise in expanding our knowledge of sickle cell retinopathy. Clinicians may monitor peripheral retinal pathology such as retinal ischemia and retinal neovascularization over progressive time points, and use sequential wide-field retinal images to monitor response to treatment. Future applications for wide-field imaging may include providing data to facilitate machine learning, and potential use in tele-ophthalmology screening for proliferative sickle retinopathy. © 2019 The Author(s).","['diagnostic imaging', '  disease severity', '  fluorescence angiography', '  human', '  monitoring', '  multimodal imaging', '  retinopathy', '  Review', '  risk factor', '  sickle cell', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle retinopathy', '  wide field imaging']",10.0,BioMed Central Ltd.,English,Review,['United States'],"[National Science Foundation, NSF, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]",['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
147,Comparison between adult patients with sickle cell disease of sub-saharan African origin born in metropolitan France and in sub-saharan Africa,2019,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) prevalence has increased rapidly in Europe as a result of an increase in the life expectancy of these patients and the arrival of SCD migrants from Africa. The aim of our study was to compare the phenotypes of adult patients born in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) who migrated to France with those of patients with the same origin who were born in France. This single-center observational study compared the demographic, clinical and biological characteristics of SCD adult patients of SSA origin who were born in France or SSA. Data were collected from computerized medical charts. Groups were compared using multivariate logistic regression with adjustment for age, gender and type of SCD. Of the 323 SCD patients followed in our center, 235 were enrolled, including 111 patients born in France and 124 patients born in SSA. SCD genotypes were balanced between groups. Patients born in Africa were older (median age 32.1 (24.4–39) vs. 25.6 (22.1–30.5) years, p < 0.001) and more often women (n = 75 (60.5%) vs. 48 (43.2%), p = 0.008). The median age at arrival in France was 18 years (13–23). The median height was lower among patients born in SSA (169 (163–175) vs. 174.5 cm (168–179), p < 0.001). Over their lifetimes, patients born in France had more acute chest syndromes (median number 2 (1–4) vs. 1 (0–3), p = 0.002), with the first episode occurring earlier (19 (11.6–22.3) vs. 24 (18.4–29.5) years, p < 0.007), and were admitted to intensive care units more often (53.3% vs. 34.9%, p = 0.006). This difference was more pronounced in the SS/Sβ0 population. Conversely, patients born in SSA had more skin ulcers (19.4% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.03). No significant differences were found in social and occupational insertion or other complications between the two groups. Patients born in SSA had a less severe disease phenotype regardless of their age than those born in France. This difference could be related to a survival bias occurring in Africa during childhood and migration to Europe that selected the least severe phenotypes. © 2019 by the authors.

149,Sequential development of human herpes virus 8-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in a 59 year old female patient with hemoglobin SC disease,2019,Pathology Research and Practice,"Hematolymphoid neoplasms, including lymphoma and myeloid neoplasms, can occur in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) or equivalent hemoglobinopathy, but an underlying connection between the two conditions has yet to be fully determined. Herein, we report a unique case of sequential development of two separate hematolymphoid neoplasms, human herpes virus 8 (HHV8)-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, in a 59 year-old African American female with hemoglobin SC disease. While etiology of immunodeficiency is unknown, the potential causes include hydroxyurea therapy, disease related immunomodulation, chronic inflammation, and relatively old age. The leukemia cells demonstrated profound trilineage dysplasia and harbored complex cytogenetic abnormalities with loss of chromosome 5q and 7q, which are often observed in therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. Besides the potential causes listed above, we propose that myeloid leukemia in this setting may result from genomic changes due to excessive hematopoietic replication triggered by a hemolysis-induced cytokine storm. While myeloid neoplasms in the setting of SCD seems to herald a dismal clinical outcome per the literature, the HHV8-positive DLBCL in our case was apparently indolent, opposing the current perception of its clinical outcome. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","['anticoagulant agent', '  decitabine', '  hemoglobin A', '  hemoglobin A2', '  hemoglobin C', '  hemoglobin F', '  hemoglobin S', '  heparin', '  hydroxyurea', '  antisickling agent', '  hydroxyurea', '  adult', '  African American', '  anemia', '  Article', '  blood transfusion', '  bone marrow biopsy', '  case report', '  cell division', '  cell lineage', '  chromosome 5q', '  chromosome 7q', '  chromosome disorder', '  chronic inflammation', '  chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', '  clinical article', '  clinical outcome', '  computer assisted tomography', '  cytokine storm', '  diffuse large B cell lymphoma', '  drug dose increase', '  dysplasia', '  female', '  gene mutation', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  hemolysis', '  hepatomegaly', '  herpes virus infection', '  human', '  human cell', '  Human herpesvirus 8', '  human tissue', '  immunomodulation', '  laboratory test', '  leukemia cell', '  low level laser therapy', '  lung embolism', '  lymphadenopathy', '  middle aged', '  physical examination', '  reticulocyte count', '  retinopathy', '  salivary gland disease', '  splenomegaly', '  cell transformation', '  chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', '  complication', '  diffuse large B cell lymphoma', '  disease exacerbation', '  fatality', '  genetics', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  herpes virus infection', '  Human herpesvirus 8', '  pathogenicity', '  risk factor', '  virology', '  Antisickling Agents', '  Cell Transformation', ' Neoplastic', '  Disease Progression', '  Fatal Outcome', '  Female', '  Hemoglobin SC Disease', '  Herpesviridae Infections', '  Herpesvirus 8', ' Human', '  Humans', '  Hydroxyurea', '  Leukemia', ' Myelomonocytic', ' Chronic', '  Lymphoma', ' Large B-Cell', ' Diffuse', '  Middle Aged', '  Risk Factors']",2.0,Elsevier GmbH,English,Article,"['China', ' United States']",[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,2
150,Assessment of macular vasculature of children with sickle cell disease compared to that of healthy controls using optical coherence tomography angiography,2019,Retina,"Purpose: This study aims at describing the macular vascular features of the eyes of pediatric patients with the homozygous form of sickle cell disease (SCD) using optical coherence tomography angiography. Methods: This is a retrospective case series of eyes of pediatric patients with SCD, raceand age-matched to those of healthy individuals. Using optical coherence tomography angiography images of superficial capillary plexus and deep capillary plexus, the nonflow area, vascular density, and foveal avascular zone were measured. The remodeled microvascular foveal architectures obtained on optical coherence tomography angiography and fluorescein angiography were compared. Results: A total of 19 eyes of patients with SCD and 18 eyes of race-matched healthy controls were examined. The best-corrected visual acuity ranged from 75 to 85 letters in all cases. In the SCD series, 8 eyes displayed signs of retinopathy on funduscopy. The foveal avascular zone was significantly enlarged, the foveal vascular density was 8% lower, and there were more perifoveal vascular alterations in the eyes of patients with SCD compared to those of controls. Conclusion: The foveal vascular density was significantly reduced and area of the foveal avascular zone was significantly increased in the eyes of patients with SCD. Consistent architectural changes in the perifoveal capillaries were also observed in the pediatric patients with SCD.

152,Relationship between retinal vessel tortuosity and oxygenation in sickle cell retinopathy,2019,International Journal of Retina and Vitreous,"Background: Reduced retinal vascular oxygen (O2) content causes tissue hypoxia and may lead to development of vision-threatening pathologies. Since increased vessel tortuosity is an early sign for some hypoxia-implicated retinopathies, we investigated a relationship between retinal vascular O2 content and vessel tortuosity indices. Methods: Dual wavelength retinal oximetry using a commercially available scanning laser ophthalmoscope was performed in both eyes of 12 healthy (NC) and 12 sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) subjects. Images were analyzed to quantify retinal arterial and venous O2 content and determine vessel tortuosity index (VTI) and vessel inflection index (VII) in circumpapillary regions. Linear mixed model analysis was used to determine the effect of disease on vascular O2 content, VTI and VII, and relate vascular O2 content with VTI and VII. Models accounted for vessel type, fellow eyes, age and mean arterial pressure. Results: Retinal arterial and venous O2 content were lower in SCR (O2A = 11 ± 4 mLO2/dL, O2V = 7 ± 2 mLO2/dL) compared to NC (O2A = 18 ± 3 mLO2/dL, O2V = 13 ± 3 mLO2/dL) subjects (p &lt; 0.001). As expected, O2 content was higher in arteries (15 ± 5 mLO2/dL) than veins (10 ± 4 mLO2/dL) (p &lt; 0.001), but not different between eyes (OD: 12 ± 5 mLO2/dL; OS:13 ± 5 mLO2/dL) (p = 0.3). VTI was not significantly different between SCR (0.18 ± 0.07) and NC (0.15 ± 0.04) subjects, or between arteries (0.18 ± 0.07) and veins (0.16 ± 0.04), or between eyes (OD: 0.18 ± 0.07, OS:0.17 ± 0.05) (p ≥ 0.06). VII was significantly higher in SCR (10 ± 2) compared to NC subjects (8 ± 1) (p = 0.003). VII was also higher in veins (9 ± 2) compared to arteries (8 ± 5) (p = 0.04), but not different between eyes (OD: 9 ± 2; OS: 9 ± 2) (p = 0.2). There was an inverse linear relationship between vascular O2 (13 ± 5 mLO2/dL) content and VII (9 ± 2) (β = -0.5; p = 0.02). Conclusions: The findings augment knowledge of relationship between retinal vascular oxygenation and morphological changes and potentially contribute to identifying biomarkers for assessment of retinal hypoxia due to SCR and other retinopathies. © 2019 The Author(s).","['oxygen', '  adult', '  Article', '  blood vessel parameters', '  clinical article', '  clinical assessment', '  cohort analysis', '  comparative study', '  controlled study', '  disease association', '  female', '  human', '  male', '  mean arterial pressure', '  middle aged', '  outcome assessment', '  oximetry', '  oxygenation', '  retina artery', '  retina blood vessel', '  retina vein', '  retinopathy', '  scanning laser ophthalmoscopy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  tissue oxygenation', '  vessel inflection index', '  vessel tortuosity index', '  visual system parameters']",7.0,BioMed Central Ltd.,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Institutes of Health, NIH]",['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
153,Association between MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism and vascular complications in sickle cell disease: A meta-analysis [Association entre MTHFR 677C>T polymorphisme et complications vasculaires dans la drépanocytose : une méta-analyse],2019,Transfusion Clinique et Biologique,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is considered as a vascular disease due to its chronic vascular manifestations such as leg ulcers, priapism, acute chest syndrome (ACS), stroke, retinopathy, renal insufficiency, pulmonary hypertension, avascular necrosis of the femoral head (AVNF) and splenic infarction. Emerging evidence has shown that the MTHFR 677C>T variant allele is associated with vascular complications (VC) in patients with SCD; however, results from individual studies are inconclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the association between the MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism and the susceptibility for VC in SCD patients. Articles published in English were collected from Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. As a result, 11 studies in different populations including 614 SCD patients with VC, and 559 patients without VC were selected. Meta-analysis in fixed effect model showed that mutant genotypes (CT + TT vs. CC) of the MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism is associated with increased risk of vascular complication (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.37–2.40, P < 0.001). This study did not demonstrate publication bias or between-study heterogeneity. Our meta-analysis establishes that the MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism as a high-penetrant risk factor for VC in SCD patients.

Methods: Patients presenting with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the Créteil University Eye Clinic, having undergone UWF-FP and ultrawide-field fluorescein angiography (UWF-FA) on the same day, were retrospectively included. Eyes with previous retinal photocoagulation were excluded. SCR was graded independently by UWF-FP and UWF-FA using Goldberg classification by two ophthalmologists with varying expertise levels. Results: Sixty-six eyes of 33 patients were included in the study. The sensitivity of UWF-FP for the detection of proliferative SCR was 100%, (95% confidence interval [CI95%] 76.8–100) for the retinal specialist and 100% (CI95% 71.5–100) for the ophthalmology resident. The specificity of UWF-FP for the detection of proliferative SCR was 100% (CI95% 92.7–100) for the retinal specialist and 98.1% (CI95% 89.7–100) for the ophthalmology resident. Conclusions: UWF-FP is a valuable exam for proliferative SCR screening, with excellent sensitivity and specificity and a good inter-grader agreement for ophthalmologists with various degree of skills, and is easy to use in a real-life setting. © 2019 by the authors.

155,Identification and Characterization of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Candidates in a Sickle Cell Disease Cohort,2019,Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with significant morbidity, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the primary curative treatment. Recently, the Brazilian Ministry of Health released a regulation that required the publically funded healthcare system to pay for HSCT for SCD patients with defined indications. We used an existing 2794-member SCD cohort established during 2013 to 2015 to characterize candidates for HSCT and estimate the number of possible donors. Of 2064 patients with SC anemia (SCA), 152 of 974 children (16%) and 279 of 1090 adults (26%) had at least 1 HSCT indication. The most common indication for transplant was stroke (n = 239) followed by avascular necrosis (n = 96), priapism (n = 82), cerebrovascular disease (n = 55), >2 vaso-occlusive episodes (n = 38), alloantibodies and chronic transfusion therapy (n = 18), and >2 acute chest syndrome episodes (n = 11). Increasing age, number of transfusions, abnormal transcranial Doppler, retinopathy, dactylitis, and use of hydroxyurea were more frequent in the 152 children with an indication for HSCT compared with 822 without (P <.001). Of 152 children and 279 adults meeting the eligibility definition, 77 (50%) and 204 (73%), respectively, had at least 1 non-SCD full sibling who could potentially serve as a donor.

156,Trajectories of biological values and vital parameters: An observational cohort study of adult patients with sickle cell disease hospitalized for a non-complicated vaso-occlusive crisis,2019,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Hospital admission of patients with sickle-cell disease (SCD) presenting with a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) can be justified by pain refractory to usual outpatient care and/or the occurrence of a complication. Yet, the trajectories of vital parameters and standard biomarkers throughout a non-complicated VOC has not been established. In this observational cohort study, we describe the course of routine parameters throughout 329 hospital stays for non-complicated VOC. We used a new spline-based approach to study and visualize non-specific time-dependent variables extracted from the hospital clinical data warehouse. We identified distinct trends during the VOC for hemoglobin level, leukocytes count, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level and temperature. Hemoglobin decreased after admission and rarely returned to steady state levels before discharge. White blood cell counts were elevated at admission before immediately decreasing, whereas eosinophils increased slowly throughout the first five days of the stay. In over 95% of non-complicated VOC-related stays, the CRP value was below 100 mg/L within the first day following admission and above normal after 48 hours, and the temperature was below 38 °C throughout the entire stay. Knowing the typical trajectories of these routine parameters during non-complicated VOC may urge the clinicians to be more vigilant in case of deviation from these patterns. © 2019 by the authors.

157,HbA1c variability and long-term glycemic control are linked to diabetic retinopathy and glomerular filtration rate in patients with type 1 diabetes and multiethnic background,2019,Journal of Diabetes and its Complications,"Aim: To evaluate the associations between HbA1c variability and long-term glycemic control with microvascular complications in type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients and multiethnic background. Methods: T1D adults with ≥ 10 years of follow-up and ≥ 2 HbA1c measurements were included. Glycemic variability was evaluated by the standard deviation (HbA1c-SD), and coefficient of variation (HbA1c-CV), and glycemic control by mean HbA1c over 10 years. Diabetic retinopathy (DR), increased urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) and reduced glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were diagnosed. Cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) was diagnosed by cardiac reflex tests. Associations between glycemic parameters with complications were assessed by multivariate logistic regressions. Results: 220 patients were included. Simultaneously adjusted for each other, mean HbA1c was independently associated with DR (OR: 2.82; 95%CI: 1.45-5.50), increased UAER (OR: 1.97; 95%CI: 1.14-3.09) and CAN (OR: 4.42; 95%CI: 1.45-13.51); whereas HbA1c-CV was independently associated with DR (OR: 8.93; 95%CI: 1.86-42.87) and reduced eGFR (OR: 7.02; 95%CI: 1.47-35.55). Conclusions: Long-term glycemic control was associated with DR, increased UAER and CAN, while glycemic variability was additionally associated with DR and impaired renal function; suggesting that both good and stable glycemic status might be important to prevent microvascular complications in T1D patients and multiethnic background. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","['angiotensin receptor antagonist', '  dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor', '  hemoglobin A1c', '  hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor', '  low density lipoprotein cholesterol', '  short acting insulin', '  glycosylated hemoglobin', '  adult', '  affinity chromatography', '  albuminuria', '  algorithm', '  Article', '  body mass', '  cardiac autonomic neuropathy', '  clinical evaluation', '  clinical laboratory', '  cohort analysis', '  comorbidity', '  diabetes mellitus', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  diastolic blood pressure', '  disease duration', '  electrocardiogram', '  epidemiological data', '  ethnicity', '  female', '  follow up', '  glomerulus filtration rate', '  glycemic control', '  hematological parameters', '  high performance liquid chromatography', '  human', '  human cell', '  hypertension', '  insulin dependent diabetes mellitus', '  insulin infusion', '  iron deficiency anemia', '  low density lipoprotein cholesterol level', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  metabolic parameters', '  prevalence', '  priority journal', '  retrospective study', '  sickle cell trait', '  systolic blood pressure', '  tertiary care center', '  thalassemia minor', '  urine sampling', '  Valsalva maneuver', '  blood', '  Brazil', '  complication', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  glucose blood level', '  insulin dependent diabetes mellitus', '  physiology', '  Adult', '  Blood Glucose', '  Brazil', '  Cohort Studies', '  Diabetes Mellitus', ' Type 1', '  Diabetic Retinopathy', '  Female', '  Glomerular Filtration Rate', '  Glycated Hemoglobin A', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Retrospective Studies']",14.0,Elsevier Inc.,English,Article,['Brazil'],[],['Brazil'],2014 - 2023,1
158,Sickle cell disease: Clinical presentation and management of a global health challenge,2019,Blood Reviews,"Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive, multisystem disorder, characterised by chronic haemolytic anaemia, painful episodes of vaso-occlusion, progressive organ failure and a reduced life expectancy. Sickle cell disease is the most common monogenetic disease, with millions affected worldwide. In well-resourced countries, comprehensive care programs have increased life expectancy of sickle cell disease patients, with almost all infants surviving into adulthood. Therapeutic options for sickle cell disease patients are however, still scarce. Predictors of sickle cell disease severity and a better understanding of pathophysiology and (epi)genetic modifiers are warranted and could lead to more precise management and treatment.

159,Spectral domain optical coherence tomography findings in Turkish sickle-cell disease and beta thalassemia major patients,2019,Journal of Current Ophthalmology,"Purpose: To assess probable structural changes using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) on sickle-cell disease (SCD) and beta thalassemia major (B-TM) patients, without any retinal abnormalities. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 32 B-TM, 34 SCD patients, and 44 healthy controls. One of the eyes of all participants was evaluated for SD-OCT and choroidal thickness, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, central macular thickness (CMT), ganglion cell complex (GCC). Results: Age, gender, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were not statistically different between the three groups. Hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrite (Htc), and ferritin levels were not statistically different between the SCD and B-TM groups. Choroidal thickness at the subfoveal region was statistically higher in the control group (353.79 ± 71.93) than in the B-TM (317.41 ± 53.44) and SCD (283.21 ± 63.27) groups. In addition, it was statistically higher in the B-TM group than the SCD group (P = 0.05). CMT did not differ among the three groups, average RNFL was only significantly thinner in SCD than in controls, and GCC thickness was significantly thinner in SCD than in controls and B-TM.

160,TEMPORAL THINNING IN SICKLE CELL RETINOPATHY IS ASSOCIATED WITH DIMINISHED PERFUSION ON OCTA AND DENSE SCOTOMA ON MICROPERIMETERY,2019,Retinal cases & brief reports,"PURPOSE: To establish correlation between the structural compromise (capillary loss and hypoperfusion on optical coherence tomography [optical coherence tomography angiography]) with perimacular functional impairment noted on microperimetry. METHODS: Retrospective case series. Clinical records and multimodal imaging findings of patients presenting with sickle cell disease were reviewed. RESULTS: Three eyes of three patients (two men) were included in the study with a visual acuity of 20/20 and no sickle cell retinopathy. Images using optical coherence tomography angiography (AngioVue OCT angiography system; Optovue, Inc, Fremont, CA) were obtained along with spectral domain optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and microperimetry (MP-1). Spectral domain optical coherence tomography revealed selective loss of inner retinal layers with thinning of the retina. Optical coherence tomography angiography revealed compromise of both superficial and deep capillaries in the area of temporal thinning expressed on spectral domain optical coherence tomography. MP-1 demonstrated focal increase in threshold (decreased sensitivity) correlating with the perfusion defects on optical coherence tomography angiography. Fluorescein angiography did not show any substantial perfusion compromise. CONCLUSION: Optical coherence tomography angiography may reflect the extent of functional compromise even before it being evident on fluorescein angiography. The area vascular compromise was larger in the deep plexus compared with the superficial plexus. The area of complete loss of retinal sensitivity corresponds to loss of vasculature in both the superficial and deep plexuses, whereas the area of decreased sensitivities corresponds to compromise only in the deep plexus.","['adolescent', '  capillary', '  case report', '  complication', '  eye fundus', '  female', '  fluorescence angiography', '  human', '  male', '  optic disk', '  optical coherence tomography', '  pathology', '  pathophysiology', '  perimetry', '  procedures', '  retina blood vessel', '  retina disease', '  retina macula lutea', '  scotoma', '  sickle cell anemia', '  vascularization', '  visual acuity', '  visual field', '  young adult', '  Adolescent', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Capillaries', '  Female', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Fundus Oculi', '  Humans', '  Macula Lutea', '  Male', '  Optic Disk', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retinal Vessels', '  Scotoma', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence', '  Visual Acuity', '  Visual Field Tests', '  Visual Fields', '  Young Adult']",6.0,NLM (Medline),English,Article,['United States'],[],[],2014 - 2023,1
161,Leg ulcer induced by hydroxycarbamide in sickle cell disease: What is the therapeutic impact?,2019,International Wound Journal,"Major sickle cell disease syndrome (SCD) is a set of potentially serious and disabling constitutional haemoglobin pathologies characterised by chronic haemolysis and vaso-occlusion phenomena. If expression takes the form of acute vaso-occlusive crisis, SCD is currently considered to be a chronic systemic pathology, primarily associated with vasculopathy and ischaemia-reperfusion phenomena. The haemolytic aspect of the disease may be associated with endothelial dysfunctional complications, including leg ulcers, which are a classic spontaneous complication of major SCD. Their frequency, all aetiologies combined, varies considerably according to the series under consideration. Hydroxycarbamide has become the standard treatment for some SCD phenotypes, but has classically been described as one of the causes of leg ulcer. This causality is widely debated and is still difficult to establish because it is a specific complication of the disease. Comorbidity factors (eg, iron deficiency) are also often implicated as causal or aggravating factors so research into all the potential aetiologies of leg ulcers in a sickle cell patient must be exhaustive. We discuss the aetiologies of a leg ulcer in a patient treated by hydrocarbamide for major SCD.

162,Angiopoietin-2 as a Marker of Retinopathy in Children and Adolescents with Sickle Cell Disease: Relation to Subclinical Atherosclerosis,2019,Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology,"Objectives:Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is a multifaceted cytokine that functions in both angiogenesis and inflammation. A proangiogenic state has been found in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD), mainly because of elevated Ang-2 levels. We determined Ang-2 level in 40 children and adolescents with SCD compared with 40 healthy controls and assessed its relation to retinopathy as well as carotid intimamedia thickness (CIMT).Methods:Hematologic profile, serum ferritin, and serum Ang-2 were measured. CIMT was assessed using high-resolution ultrasound. Fundus examination was performed followed by fundus fluorescein angiography. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) was used to find small vascular changes not clinically manifested.Results:Ang-2 levels and CIMT were significantly higher in SCD patients compared with controls. The incidence of nonproliferative retinopathy was 45%. SCD patients with retinopathy were older in age with a history of sickling crisis of >3 attacks per year and had a higher incidence of sickle cell anemia than sickle β-Thalassemia. Ang-2 cutoff value 9000 pg/mL could significantly detect the presence of retinopathy among SCD patients with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Serum Ang-2 levels were positively correlated with HbS and CIMT. Logistic regression analysis revealed that Ang-2 and HbS significantly contribute to retinopathy among patients with SCD.Conclusions:Elevated Ang-2 highlights the role of angiogenesis in the pathophysiology of SCD and may be considered a promising marker for screening of patients at risk of sickle retinopathy and vascular dysfunction. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

163,Prevalence and Onset of Pediatric Sickle Cell Retinopathy,2019,Ophthalmology,"Purpose: Children with sickle cell hemoglobinopathy (SCH) can demonstrate proliferative retinopathy with vision loss, but lack of consensus exists regarding screening regimens. We sought to determine the prevalence, age at onset, and risk factors associated with sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) to inform development of screening guidelines for asymptomatic children. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Participants: Children with SCH over a 4-year period. Methods: Prevalences of any retinopathy, nonproliferative retinopathy (NPR), and proliferative retinopathy (PR), determined as proportions of all children examined, were calculated. Subgroup analyses were completed by SCH genotype. Ages at first diagnosis were reported using standard descriptive statistics. The association of potential risk factors with retinopathy were assessed using univariate and multivariate linear and logistic regression. Main Outcome Measures: Outcomes were prevalence, age at onset, and type of SCR, based on examination by an ophthalmologist. Markers of SCH severity (number of emergency room or hospital admissions for crises, number of blood transfusions, hydroxyurea therapy, transcranial Doppler–confirmed cerebral vasculopathy), genotype, gender, and race were evaluated as SCR risk factors. Results: Of 398 children (mean age, 9.6±4.6 years; range 0–18 years), 208 (52%) showed sickle cell homozygote (SS) genotype, 113 (28%) showed sickle cell hemoglobin C (SC) genotype, and 77 (19%) showed trait genotype. Forty-eight children (12.1%) demonstrated SCR, 44 of 398 children (11.1%; 95% confidence interval, 8.3%–14.5%) demonstrated NPR, and 9 of 398 children (2.3%; 95% confidence interval, 1.2%–4.2%) demonstrated PR. Prevalence was higher for SC than SS genotype for NPR (21% vs. 9%) and PR (5% vs. 1%); onset for SC genotype was earlier than that for SS genotype for NPR (youngest diagnosis 4.8 vs. 6.1 years) and PR (12.2 vs. 15.4 years). No other risk factors were associated significantly with SCR. Conclusions: Clinical markers of SCH severity assessed were not associated with SCR and are not necessary for screening guidelines. Based on our study and literature review, although screening could begin at age 5 years for NPR, screening of children without ophthalmologic symptoms to identify treatment-requiring PR could begin later, at 9 years of age for SC and 13 years of age for SS. © 2019 American Academy of Ophthalmology","['hemoglobin C', '  hydroxyurea', '  adolescent', '  adult', '  Article', '  asymptomatic disease', '  blood transfusion', '  cerebrovascular disease', '  child', '  cohort analysis', '  controlled study', '  disease association', '  disease severity', '  female', '  genotype', '  hospital admission', '  human', '  infant', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  newborn', '  onset age', '  practice guideline', '  prevalence', '  priority journal', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  retinopathy', '  retrospective study', '  risk factor', '  school child', '  screening', '  sickle cell anemia', '  transcranial Doppler ultrasonography', '  complication', '  onset age', '  Pennsylvania', '  preschool child', '  prevalence', '  retina disease', '  risk factor', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Adolescent', '  Age of Onset', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Child', '  Child', ' Preschool', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Infant', '  Male', '  Philadelphia', '  Prevalence', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Risk Factors']",12.0,Elsevier Inc.,English,Article,"['United Kingdom', ' United States']","[National Institutes of Health, NIH]",['United States'],2014 - 2023,2
164,Paramacular temporal atrophy in sickle cell disease occurs early in childhood,2019,British Journal of Ophthalmology,"Background/aims Initially reported in a few patients with homozygous sickle cell disease (SCD), atrophic areas of the retina temporal from the macula are now known to be present in about 48% of eyes of adult patients with SS-SCD and in 35% of eyes of adult patients with SC-SCD. The aim of this study is to describe this paramacular atrophy in children affected with SCD. Methods In this retrospective series, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography images of 81 children with SCD, acquired with specific patterns including one evaluating the retina temporal to the macula, were reviewed, in order to look for retinal atrophy. Fundus examination status for SCD peripheral retinopathy was also reviewed. Results Mean age was 12.0 years (SD: 3.56). The genotype distribution was: 64 HbSS (79%), 10 HbSC (12%) and 7 HbS/β 0 thalassaemia (9%). Using a usual fovea-centred programme, retinal atrophy was found in 38% of eyes (52% of children). Using a specific temporal pattern, retinal atrophy was found in 53% of eyes (64% of children), with no significant difference in the prevalence between HbSS and HbSC genotype (p=0.92), and no effect of age (mean 12.3 years (SD=3.61) vs11.9 (3.56), p=0.65). Peripheral retinopathy was found in 11% of children, with a significant relation between the HbSC genotype and the severity of the retinopathy (p=0.003). Conclusion Paramacular temporal atrophy occurs early in the course of SCD, which suggests distinct mechanisms from those of peripheral retinopathy. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

165,Supervised machine learning based multi-task artificial intelligence classification of retinopathies,2019,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Artificial intelligence (AI) classification holds promise as a novel and affordable screening tool for clinical management of ocular diseases. Rural and underserved areas, which suffer from lack of access to experienced ophthalmologists may particularly benefit from this technology. Quantitative optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) imaging provides excellent capability to identify subtle vascular distortions, which are useful for classifying retinovascular diseases. However, application of AI for differentiation and classification of multiple eye diseases is not yet established. In this study, we demonstrate supervised machine learning based multi-task OCTA classification. We sought 1) to differentiate normal from diseased ocular conditions, 2) to differentiate different ocular disease conditions from each other, and 3) to stage the severity of each ocular condition. Quantitative OCTA features, including blood vessel tortuosity (BVT), blood vascular caliber (BVC), vessel perimeter index (VPI), blood vessel density (BVD), foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area (FAZ-A), and FAZ contour irregularity (FAZ-CI) were fully automatically extracted from the OCTA images. A stepwise backward elimination approach was employed to identify sensitive OCTA features and optimal-feature-combinations for the multi-task classification. For proof-of-concept demonstration, diabetic retinopathy (DR) and sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) were used to validate the supervised machine leaning classifier. The presented AI classification methodology is applicable and can be readily extended to other ocular diseases, holding promise to enable a mass-screening platform for clinical deployment and telemedicine. © 2019 by the authors.

166,Longitudinal Study of Peripapillary Thinning in Sickle Cell Hemoglobinopathies,2019,American Journal of Ophthalmology,"Purpose: To determine the rate of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning in patients with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies. Design: This was a prospective cohort study. Methods: Sixty-seven patients averaging 35.8 ± 11.5 years of age at enrollment with electrophoretically confirmed sickle cell hemoglobinopathies followed by the University of Illinois at Chicago retina clinic for ≥1 year were included. Exclusion criteria included a history of diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, glaucoma, ocular opacities, other retinopathies, and previous retinal procedures. The optic nerve head RNFL thicknesses were measured with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (Heidelberg Engineering, Inc) at enrollment and subsequent follow-ups. Linear mixed models were used to estimate rates of thinning. Results: A total of 122 eyes were followed for 3.8 ± 2.0 years (range 1–8 years). Mean global peripapillary RNFL thickness was 100.9 ± 13.0 μm at baseline. Global peripapillary RNFL thickness decreased at a rate of 0.98 μm per year (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77–1.19 μm/year). A history of stroke was associated with a faster rate of global RNFL thinning (1.72 ± 0.20 vs 0.79 ± 0.12 μm/year, P < .001), whereas a history of hypertension was associated with a slower rate of thinning (0.33 ± 0.27 vs 1.14 ± 0.12 μm/year, P = .002). Conclusions: Peripapillary RNFL thinning in patients with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies occurred faster in patients with a history of stroke and slower in patients with controlled hypertension.

167,Clinical Outcomes of a Hospital-Based Teleophthalmology Service: What Happens to Patients in a Virtual Clinic?,2019,Ophthalmology Retina,"Purpose: Demographic changes as well as increasing referral rates from national screening services put pressure on available ophthalmologic resources in the United Kingdom. To improve resource allocation, virtual medical retina clinics were introduced in 2016 in Moorfields Eye Hospital, South Division. The scope of this work was to assess clinical outcomes of patients followed up in a virtual clinic setting. Design: Retrospective database study. Participants: Patients booked for a consecutive appointment in our virtual medical retina clinic. Methods: Seven hundred twenty-eight patients booked for their second virtual clinic appointment in a tertiary eye care referral center between November 2016 and July 2018 were identified retrospectively from our electronic health records and patient administration systems. Information about disease grade and clinical and visual outcomes was assessed. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical outcome of the virtual clinic visit, including virtual follow-up, urgent referral to face-to-face clinic, or discharge. Results: Seven hundred twelve of 728 patients received a clinical outcome. Four hundred ninety-seven patients (70%) were eligible for further virtual follow-up after the second virtual clinic visit, whereas 15% each (107 and 108 patients) were either discharged or referred to a face-to-face clinic. In total, 661 patients attended their appointments in person and were reviewed by trained staff. Seventeen patients were referred for urgent treatment and 8 patients were not suitable for virtual follow-up. In 542 (82%) of all patients, diabetic retinopathy was the most common diagnosis. Conclusions: This study reports clinical outcomes of a virtual model of care for medical retina clinics that imply safety of patient care in this clinic setting. This clinic format optimizes the use of already available resources and increases the skills of our existing workforce while maintaining high-quality clinical standards. © 2019 American Academy of Ophthalmology","['adult', '  age related macular degeneration', '  aged', '  Article', '  chorioretinopathy', '  choroidal nevus', '  clinical outcome', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  electronic health record', '  eye disease', '  eye photography', '  face to face support group', '  female', '  follow up', '  health service', '  hospital based teleophthalmology service', '  hospital discharge', '  human', '  intraocular pressure', '  macular telangiectasia', '  major clinical study', '  middle aged', '  optical coherence tomography', '  patient attendance', '  patient safety', '  priority journal', '  retina vein occlusion', '  retrospective study', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  teleconsultation', '  telemedicine', '  tertiary health care', '  very elderly', '  virtual medical retina clinic', '  vitelliform macular degeneration', '  young adult', '  health care delivery', '  male', '  ophthalmology', '  organization and management', '  outpatient department', '  theoretical model', '  United Kingdom', '  Adult', '  Aged', '  Aged', ' 80 and over', '  Ambulatory Care Facilities', '  Female', '  Health Services Accessibility', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Models', ' Theoretical', '  Ophthalmology', '  Retrospective Studies', '  Telemedicine', '  United Kingdom', '  Young Adult']",27.0,Elsevier Inc,English,Article,"['Germany', ' United Kingdom']",[Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust],['United Kingdom'],2014 - 2023,2

169,Indications and outcomes of vitrectomy surgery in a series of 1000 black African eyes,2019,BMJ Open Ophthalmology,"Objective To determine the common indications for, and outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy surgery among black Africans in a low-resource setting. Methods and Analysis A retrospective, non-comparative case review was undertaken. Data from 1000 consecutive eyes of 1000 patients in a single centre who underwent pars plana vitrectomy surgery between May 2005 and July 2013 were used for the study. Demographic data, primary indication for surgery, ocular status and outcomes were assessed. Results Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment was the most common primary indication occurring in 61.8% of eyes. Diabetic vitrectomy, trauma and proliferative sickle cell retinopathy were also common indications occurring in 10.1%, 6.1% and 4.5% of eyes, respectively. At presentation, 33% of patients with retinal detachment had some form of proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and half of those had the more advanced grades C and D. Patients presented on an average of 13.5 months after onset of symptoms. As a result, visual outcomes were less than other reported studies. Conclusion Retinal detachment was the most common indication for vitrectomy, but even these cases presented late with an advanced presentation. This study highlights the need for affordable and accessible vitreoretinal services in Sub-Saharan Africa and increased awareness of general eye health, along with strategies to reduce trauma and identify early those at risk of chronic eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and sickle cell retinopathy. © 2019 Author(s).",,9.0,BMJ Publishing Group,English,Article,"['Ghana', ' Niger', ' Nigeria']",[],"['Niger', 'Nigeria']",2014 - 2023,3

A systematic review,2019,Blood Reviews,"For over four decades, efforts have been underway for the evaluation of sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) in an attempt to identify peripheral high-risk vascular abnormalities based on Goldberg's classification (gold-standard) (1971). The macula is an area in the center of the retina that is responsible for high-resolution central vision and is also affected in SCR. With the development of new technologies for retinal imaging, the macula became a main focus of interest in the study of sickle cell disease (SCD). Optical coherence tomography angiography is a modern non-invasive method that allows qualitative and quantitative analysis of the retinal vascular network in the macular region. We identified 86 studies on SCD and optical coherence tomography angiography. Of those, 12 met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. The prevalence of sickle cell maculopathy was 45.6% in the SCD population and it increased with age. We present the main vascular findings and discuss visual impairment and pathophysiology, genotypes, and peripheral high-risk vascular abnormalities.

173,Morphine promotes neovascularizing retinopathy in sickle transgeneic mice,2019,Blood Advances,"Neovascularizing retinopathy is a significant complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), occurring more frequently in HbSC than HbSS disease. This risk difference is concordant with a divergence of angiogenesis risk, as identified by levels of pro- vs anti-angiogenic factors in the sickle patient’s blood. Because our prior studies documented that morphine promotes angiogenesis in both malignancy and wound healing, we tested whether chronic opioid treatment would promote retinopathy in NY1DD sickle transgenic mice. After 10 to 15 months of treatment, sickle mice treated with morphine developed neovascularizing retinopathy to a far greater extent than either of the controls (sickle mice treated with saline and wild-type mice treated identically with morphine). Our dissection of the mechanistic linkage between morphine and retinopathy revealed a complex interplay among morphine engagement with its m opioid receptor (MOR) on retinal endothelial cells (RECs); morphine-induced production of tumor necrosis factor a and interleukin-6 (IL-6), causing increased expression of both MOR and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) on RECs; morphine/MOR engagement transactivating VEGFR2; and convergence of MOR, VEGFR2, and IL-6 activation on JAK/STAT3-dependent REC proliferation and angiogenesis. In the NY1DD mice, the result was increased angiogenesis, seen as neovascularizing retinopathy, similar to the retinal pathology occurring in humans with SCD. Therefore, we conclude that chronic opioid exposure, superimposed on the already angiogenic sickle milieu, might enhance risk for retinopathy. These results provide an additional reason for development and application of opioid alternatives for pain control in SCD. © 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.","['interleukin 6', '  Janus kinase', '  morphine', '  mu opiate receptor', '  STAT3 protein', '  tumor necrosis factor', '  vasculotropin receptor 2', '  adverse outcome', '  animal cell', '  animal experiment', '  animal model', '  Article', '  cell proliferation', '  controlled study', '  cytokine production', '  endothelium cell', '  neovascularizing retinopathy', '  nonhuman', '  priority journal', '  protein expression', '  retina cell', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  transgenic mouse', '  tumor vascularization', '  upregulation', '  wound healing']",6.0,American Society of Hematology,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Heart, Blood Institute]",['United States'],2014 - 2023,1

However, clinical optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) instruments lack the function of artery-vein differentiation. This study aims to verify the feasibility of using OCT intensity feature analysis to guide artery-vein differentiation in OCTA. Four OCT intensity profile features, including i) ratio of vessel width to central reflex, ii) average of maximum profile brightness, iii) average of median profile intensity, and iv) optical density of vessel boundary intensity compared to background intensity, are used to classify artery-vein source nodes in OCT. A blood vessel tracking algorithm is then employed to automatically generate the OCT artery-vein map.

177,Differential artery–vein analysis improves the performance of OCTA staging of sickle cell retinopathy,2019,Translational Vision Science and Technology,"Purpose: We test if differential artery–vein analysis can increase the performance of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) detection and classification of sickle cell retinopathy (SCR). Method: This observational case series was conducted in a tertiary-retina practice. Color fundus and OCTA images were collected from 20 control and 48 SCR subjects. Fundus data were collected from fundus imaging devices, and SD-OCT and corresponding OCTA data were acquired using a spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) angiography system. For each patient, color fundus image-guided artery–vein classification was conducted in the OCTA image. Traditional mean blood vessel tortuosity (m-BVT) and mean blood vessel caliber (m-BVC) in OCTA images were quantified for control and SCR groups. Artery BVC (a-BVC), vein BVC (v-BVC), artery BVT (a-BVT), and vein BVT (v-BVT) were calculated; and then the artery–vein ratio of BVC (AVR–BVC) and artery–vein ratio of BVT (AVR–BVT) were quantified for comparative analysis. Results: We evaluated 40 control and 85 SCR images in this study. The color fundus image-guided artery–vein classification had 97.02% accuracy for differentiating arteries and veins in OCTA. Differential artery–vein analysis provided significant improvement (P < 0.05) in detecting and classifying SCR stages compared to traditional mean blood vessel analysis. AVR–BVT and AVR–BVC showed significant (P < 0.001) correlation with SCR severity. Conclusions: Differential artery–vein analysis can significantly improve the performance of OCTA detection and classification of SCR. AVR–BVT is the most sensitive feature that can classify control and mild SCR. Translational Relevance: SCR and other retinovascular diseases result in changes to the caliber and tortuosity appearance of arteries and veins separately.

Methods: Forty-four confirmed steady-state SCD patients aged 16 years and above were recruited consecutively. The Doppler velocimetric indices of their right renal artery and both CRAs were obtained. The CIMT was also measured on each side via B-mode ultrasonography. The subjects were categorized by age and sex. Mean and median values for each group were determined. The Spearman correlation test was used to quantify the relationships between CIMT and the Doppler parameters. Results: The participants had a median age of 24.50 years (interquartile range, 12.50 to 36.50 years). Twenty-three were men (52.3%) and 21 were women (47.7%). The median CIMT was 0.70 mm (IQR, 0.50 to 0.90 mm). Significant correlations with the CIMT were found for the CRA peak systolic velocity (r=0.312, P=0.003), the renal artery resistivity index (RI) (r=0.284, P=0.007), and the renal artery pulsatility index (PI) (r=0.273, P=0.010). There was no significant relationship between the CIMT and the CRA end-diastolic velocity, CRA RI, or CRA PI. Conclusion: CIMT in SCD patients was higher than in the previously reported age groups of the reference populations.

181,Curing hemoglobinopathies: Challenges and advances of conventional and new gene therapy approaches,2019,Mediterranean Journal of Hematology and Infectious Diseases,"Inherited hemoglobin disorders, including beta-thalassemia (BT) and sickle-cell disease (SCD), are the most common monogenic diseases worldwide, with a global carrier frequency of over 5%.1 With migration, they are becoming more common worldwide, making their management and care an increasing concern for health care systems. BT is characterized by an imbalance in the α/β-globin chain ratio, ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic hemolytic anemia, and compensatory hemopoietic expansion.1 Globally, there are over 25,000 births each year with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT). The currently available treatment for TDT is lifelong transfusions and iron chelation therapy or allogenic bone marrow transplantation as a curative option. SCD affects 300 million people worldwide2 and severely impacts the quality of life of patients who experience unpredictable, recurrent acute and chronic severe pain, stroke, infections, pulmonary disease, kidney disease, retinopathy, and other complications. While survival has been dramatically extended, quality of life is markedly reduced by disease- and treatment-associated morbidity. The development of safe, tissue-specific and efficient vectors, and efficient gene-editing technologies has led to the development of several gene therapy trials for BT and SCD. However, the complexity of the approach presents its hurdles. Fundamental factors at play include the requirement for myeloablation on a patient with benign disease, the age of the patient, and the consequent bone marrow microenvironment. A successful path from proof-of-concept studies to commercialization must render gene therapy a sustainable and accessible approach for a large number of patients. Furthermore, the cost of these therapies is a considerable challenge for the health care system. While new promising therapeutic options are emerging,3,4 and many others are on the pipeline,5 gene therapy can potentially cure patients. We herein provide an overview of the most recent, likely potentially curative therapies for hemoglobinopathies and a summary of the challenges that these approaches entail. © 2019 Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore.

A 26-item single interviewer administered questionnaire was used to obtain socio-demographic data, highest level of education completed, employment status, sickle cell genotype, if known, frequency of clinic attendance and patients' knowledge, beliefs and practices. Ten of these were yes/no questions, whereas eight required that they choose correct answers from four choices. Results: one hundred subjects were recruited, 72% had homozygous SS disease. Their ages ranged from 18-63 years (mean 34.1 years, SD11.3). Fifty six percent were female. Most (75%) had achieved at least secondary education. The majority (62%) were unemployed. The mean belief score was 3.6/6(60%) and the mean knowledge and practice scores were 3.3/7(47%) and 2.2/5(44%) respectively. Milder genotypes had higher knowledge scores vs the more severe genotypes (4.0 vs 3.2, P=0.013). Only 28% had regular eye examinations; less than 50% had seen an ophthalmologist in the past year. Pract ice scores were higher in employed than in unemployed patients (2.6 vs 1.9, (P=0.04)). Employed patients were more likely than the unemployed to see their eye doctor for regular eye ""examinations"" (42.1% vs 19.4%, χ2=6.0, P=0.02). The practice and knowledge scores correlated (r2=0.363, P<0.001) and belief score (r2=0.304, P =0.002), except where 98% believed they should see an ophthalmologist annually, but only 42% did, and 21% had never. Conclusion: knowledge scores were fair, however, the practice was not always in keeping with knowledge. © Paa-Kwesi Blankson et al. The Pan African Medical Journal.

183,Hemoglobin level and macular thinning in sickle cell disease,2019,Clinical Ophthalmology,"Purpose: To study the relationship between complete blood count (CBC) indices over time, particularly serum hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and severity of macular thinning on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Methods: This is a single-center, retrospective analysis of 141 consecutive SCD patients over a 10-year period, of which 40 patients (79 eyes) had SD-OCT imaging of the macula and 29 (58 eyes, mean age 17.5 years) were eligible for the study. Investigators reviewed electronic medical records for documentation of retinopathy stage, disease genotype, CBC values, and SD-OCT imaging. SD-OCT parameters and CBC values were compared between different retinopathy stages and disease genotypes. Regression analyses were performed on SD-OCT parameters and CBC values. Results: Of the 58 eligible eyes (34HbSS, 18HbSC, 4HbSβ +thal, 2HbS βthal), 18 had PSR (proliferative sickle retinopathy), 14 had NPSR (nonproliferative sickle retinopathy), and 26 had NSR (no sickle retinopathy). Hb values were higher in SC group compared to SS group. Macular thickness in the temporal inner (Δ=26±33 um, p=0.01) and outer (Δ=21±30 um, p=0.02) subﬁelds was higher in SC compared to SS group. Patients with SD-OCT thinning below the 5th percentile in the temporal outer subﬁelds had lower recorded Hb nadirs (6.0 ±0.9) compared to those with thickness within the top 95th percentile (9.1±2.3). Regression analysis showed temporal macular thickness to be positively correlated with Hb values in the SS group. Conclusion: Macular thinning observed on SD-OCT in SCD patients with SS genotype may be related to the level of anemia in this population. © 2019 Hussnain et al.","['hemoglobin', '  adolescent', '  adult', '  Article', '  blood cell count', '  controlled study', '  disease severity', '  electronic medical record', '  female', '  genotype', '  hemoglobin determination', '  human', '  macular thickness', '  macular thinning', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  mean corpuscular volume', '  nonproliferative sickle retinopathy', '  proliferative sickle retinopathy', '  retina maculopathy', '  retinopathy', '  retrospective study', '  sickle cell anemia', '  spectral domain optical coherence tomography', '  thrombocyte']",5.0,Dove Medical Press Ltd,English,Article,['United States'],"[RPB, Yale University]",['United States'],2014 - 2023,1

185,Sickle cell retinopathy. A focused review,2019,Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology,"Purpose: To provide a focused review of sickle cell retinopathy in the light of recent advances in the pathogenesis, multimodal retinal imaging, management of the condition, and migration trends, which may lead to increased prevalence of the condition in the Western world. Methods: Non-systematic focused literature review. Results: Sickle retinopathy results from aggregation of abnormal hemoglobin in the red blood cells in the retinal microcirculation, leading to reduced deformability of the red blood cells, stagnant blood flow in the retinal precapillary arterioles, thrombosis, and ischemia. This may be precipitated by hypoxia, acidosis, and hyperosmolarity. Sickle retinopathy may result in sight threatening complications, such as paracentral middle maculopathy or sequelae of proliferative retinopathy, such as vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment. New imaging modalities, such as wide-field imaging and optical coherence tomography angiography, have revealed the microstructural features of sickle retinopathy, enabling earlier diagnosis. The vascular growth factor ANGPTL-4 has recently been identified as a potential mediator of progression to proliferative retinopathy and may represent a possible therapeutic target. Laser therapy should be considered for proliferative retinopathy in order to prevent visual loss; however, the evidence is not very strong. With recent development of wide-field imaging, targeted laser to ischemic retina may prove to be beneficial. Exact control of intraoperative intraocular pressure, including valved trocar vitrectomy systems, may improve the outcomes of vitreoretinal surgery for complications, such as vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment. Stem cell transplantation and gene therapy are potentially curative treatments, which may prevent retinopathy. Conclusions: There is lack of evidence regarding the optimal management of sickle retinopathy. Further study is needed to determine if recent progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology and diagnosis of sickle retinopathy may translate into improved management and outcome. © 2019, The Author(s).","['hemoglobin', '  complication', '  diagnostic imaging', '  eye fundus', '  fluorescence angiography', '  global health', '  human', '  laser coagulation', '  metabolism', '  optical coherence tomography', '  prevalence', '  procedures', '  retina', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Fundus Oculi', '  Global Health', '  Hemoglobins', '  Humans', '  Laser Coagulation', '  Prevalence', '  Retina', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence']",24.0,Springer Verlag,English,Review,"['United Arab Emirates', ' Saudi Arabia', ' Sweden']",[],['Saudi Arabia'],2014 - 2023,3
186,Proliferative retinopathy and maculopathy are two independent conditions in sickle cell disease: Is there a role of blood rheology?,2019,Clinical Hemorheology and Microcirculation,"OBJECTIVE: Our study investigated the prevalence of retinopathy and maculopathy in sickle cell patients and tested the association between these two conditions. In addition, we tested whether hematological and hemorheological parameters, as well as genotype, were involved in the development of these two conditions. METHODS: Seventy sickle cell adult patients were recruited: 37 with sickle cell anemia (SCA) and 33 with sickle cell hemoglobin C disease (SCC). All patients underwent retinal examination and macular ocular coherence tomography. Blood was sampled for the measurements of hematological and hemorheological parameters. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients had maculopathy and 30 had retinopathy with no significant difference between SCA and SCC patients. No association between the presence of retinopathy and maculopathy was detected. RBC aggregation was higher and RBC deformability lower at 3 Pa in SCA patients. Blood viscosity and hematocrit were higher in SCC than in SCA patients. However, no association was found between biological parameters and the ocular complications studied. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that retinopathy and maculopathy are common in sickle cell disease. Nevertheless, we found no association with hematological parameters, blood rheology or genotype. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

191,Clinical and Ophthalmic Factors Associated With the Severity of Sickle Cell Retinopathy,2019,American Journal of Ophthalmology,"Purpose: To identify associations between severity of sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) and other clinical, laboratory, or treatment factors relevant to sickle cell disease (SCD). Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: We investigated clinical, laboratory, and demographic associations with the severity of SCR in 296 patients seen at both our SCD specialty clinic and our retina clinic. Multivariate multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the association between each clinical variable and severity of SCR. Results: Multivariate analysis showed that in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) genotypes, older age (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.15; P <.001) and male sex (95% CI, 0.13-0.87; P =.02) were associated with proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (PSR). In patients with genotypic variants, visual symptoms (95% CI, 1.36-21.62; P =.02) were associated with PSR. Laser photocoagulation and vitrectomy surgery, the standard interventions for PSR, were associated with older age (95% CI, 1.05-1.13; P <.001), visual symptoms (95% CI, 1.48-7.40; P =.004), higher hemoglobin level (95% CI, 1.14-1.65; P =.001), and no chronic transfusion (95% CI, 0.16-1.09; P =.08) across the whole cohort. Conclusions: These findings may inform clinicians of the symptoms, systemic findings, and disease-modifying therapies most frequently associated with SCR in SCD patients. Visual symptoms such as blurred vision or floaters were associated with progression of SCR and may be criteria for referral for retinal examination. Chronic transfusion therapy may be protective against the need for retinal laser photocoagulation or vitrectomy. Prospective studies are necessary to further explore risk factors for SCR and to identify which individuals with SCD are at risk for incident or progression of retinopathy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","['acetylsalicylic acid', '  anticoagulant agent', '  hemoglobin', '  heparin', '  warfarin', '  adult', '  age', '  Article', '  blood transfusion', '  cohort analysis', '  controlled study', '  disease severity', '  female', '  gender', '  genotype', '  hemoglobin blood level', '  human', '  laser coagulation', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  priority journal', '  proliferative sickle cell retinopathy', '  retinopathy', '  retrospective study', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  vitrectomy', '  aged', '  complication', '  middle aged', '  pathology', '  prospective study', '  retina disease', '  risk factor', '  severity of illness index', '  sickle cell anemia', '  statistical model', '  Adult', '  Aged', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Logistic Models', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Prospective Studies', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retrospective Studies', '  Risk Factors', '  Severity of Illness Index']",13.0,Elsevier Inc.,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
192,Utility of ultra-widefield retinal imaging for the staging and management of sickle cell retinopathy,2019,Retina,"Purpose: To determine whether ultra-widefield (UWF) retinal imaging changes the staging or management of sickle cell retinopathy compared with clinical examination. Methods: Prospective, observational study including patients with sickle cell disease. All patients underwent dilated fundus examination by a fellowship-trained retina specialist, as well as UWF fundus photography (FF) and fluorescein angiography (FA). Sickle retinopathy stage and treatment recommendation per eye were determined after clinical examination, UWF-FF, and UWF-FA, respectively, and differences in retinopathy stage and treatment recommendation were compared. Results: A total of 70 eyes from 35 patients (17 women, 48.6%), mean age 30.4 years, were included. Sickle genotypes included 26 patients with sickle SS (74.3%), 7 SC (20.0%), and 2 b(+)thalassemia (5.7%). Based on examination, most eyes (42/70; 60.0%) had no visible retinopathy. Based on UWF-FF, about half of the eyes were found to be Goldberg Stage 2 or above (36/70; 51.4%). Based on UWF-FA, nearly all eyes were Goldberg Stage 2 or above (63/70; 90%). However, clinical examination reliably detected neovascularization, and in no case did the addition of UWF imaging change management relative to examination alone. Conclusion: Ultra-widefield imaging detects a higher stage of sickle cell retinopathy compared with clinical examination alone, but these differences may not be clinically significant. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

193,Progressive Retinal Thinning in Sickle Cell Retinopathy,2018,Ophthalmology Retina,"Purpose: To determine the rate of retinal thinning on spectral-domain (SD) OCT in patients with sickle cell compared with controls. Design: Retrospective, longitudinal study. Participants: Patients with sickle cell and age-similar control patients with SD-OCT macula volume scans at least 10 months apart were reviewed. Methods: Automated segmentation of the SD-OCT macula volume scans was performed using the Iowa Reference Algorithms to divide the retina into 3 combined retina layers: superficial (retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer), middle (inner plexiform layer and inner nuclear layer), and outer (outer plexiform layer to retinal pigment epithelium). The mean retinal thickness in each Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) subfield was recorded. The rate of retinal thickness change was calculated using a multilevel mixed-effects model. Main Outcome Measures: The rate of retinal thickness change in the superficial, middle, and outer retina. Results: Thirty-eight eyes of 24 patients with sickle cell (age: mean 40 years, range 18–67 years; genotype: 12 hemoglobin SS, 11 hemoglobin SC, 1 not available) and 30 eyes of 30 control patients were followed on average for 25.5 months. The mean initial retinal thickness was thinner in the sickle cell group compared with the control group (superficial: 69.95 vs. 72.22 μm; middle: 65.24 vs. 71.22 μm; outer: 171.37 vs. 175.55 μm). The mean rate of retinal thinning was greater for the sickle cell group than the control group (superficial: −0.89 vs. −0.41 μm/year; middle: −0.45 vs. +0.18 μm/year; outer: −0.50 vs. −0.02 μm/year). The rate of thinning in patients with sickle cell was statistically significant (P < 0.05) for the superficial retina in the center subfield and nasal and temporal inner subfields, as well as the middle retina in the temporal inner subfield. Compared with controls, there was a faster rate of retinal thinning for the middle retina in the temporal inner subfield. Rates of retinal thinning were similar regardless of whether qualitative areas of focal retinal thinning were seen on initial imaging. Conclusions: Patients with sickle cell exhibit a progressive retinal thinning predominantly affecting the superficial and middle retina that may represent chronic microvascular insult. © 2018 American Academy of Ophthalmology","['adult', '  Article', '  clinical article', '  controlled study', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  epiretinal membrane', '  human', '  image analysis', '  longitudinal study', '  priority journal', '  retina degeneration', '  retinal thickness', '  retinopathy', '  spectral domain optical coherence tomography', '  visual acuity']",8.0,Elsevier Inc,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
194,Increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes-related complications in combined type 2 diabetes and sickle cell trait,2018,Diabetes Care,"OBJECTIVE The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is rapidly increasing in sub-Saharan Africa, where sickle cell trait (SCT) is also frequent. Although SCT is generally considered a benign condition, evidence suggests that SCT could exaggerate vascular dysfunction in T2D. However, it remains unclear whether SCT could increase the risk of the development of T2D complications. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine whether T2D complications were more prevalent among Senegalese individuals with SCT and T2D than among those with T2D only. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Rates of hypertension, retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral artery disease, and impaired renal function as well as arterial stiffness, blood rheology, and concentrations of plasma advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and cytokines were compared between groups of Senegalese individuals with combined SCT and T2D (T2D-SCT) (n = 60), T2D (n = 52), SCT (n = 53), and neither T2D nor SCT (control) (n = 56). Human aortic endothelial cell (HAEC) expression of inflammatory and adhesion factors was measured after treatment with tumor necrosis factor-a and subjects' plasma. Effects of AGE inhibition or tiron on HAEC expression of E-selectin were measured. RESULTS Retinopathy, hypertension, and reduced renal function were more prevalent, and arterial stiffness, blood viscosity at high shear rates, and thixotropic index were higher, in the SCT group compared with the other groups. Multivariable analysis showed that plasma AGE concentration was significantly associated with arterial stiffness. E-selectin expression was elevated in HAECs treated with T2D-SCT plasma compared with the other groups, but AGE inhibition reversed this. CONCLUSIONS SCT could potentially augment the risk of the development of T2D-related complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and hypertension. © 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.","['advanced glycation end product', '  endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1', '  glucose', '  immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein', '  messenger RNA', '  protein ZO1', '  tumor necrosis factor', '  vascular cell adhesion molecule 1', '  adult', '  aortic endothelial cell', '  arterial stiffness', '  Article', '  blood rheology', '  blood viscosity', '  cohort analysis', '  controlled study', '  diabetic complication', '  diabetic hypertension', '  diabetic nephropathy', '  diabetic neuropathy', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  disease course', '  female', '  glucose blood level', '  human', '  human cell', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  mean arterial pressure', '  middle aged', '  non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus', '  peripheral neuropathy', '  peripheral occlusive artery disease', '  prevalence', '  protein blood level', '  protein expression', '  pulse wave', '  Senegalese', '  shear rate', '  sickle cell trait', '  systolic blood pressure', '  vascular disease', '  blood', '  case control study', '  complication', '  diabetic complication', '  hypertension', '  non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus', '  prevalence', '  Senegal', '  sickle cell trait', '  Adult', '  Case-Control Studies', '  Diabetes Complications', '  Diabetes Mellitus', ' Type 2', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Hypertension', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Prevalence', '  Senegal', '  Sickle Cell Trait']",15.0,American Diabetes Association Inc.,English,Article,"['France', ' Senegal']",[Campus France],['France'],2014 - 2023,2
195,Elevated fetal haemoglobin levels are associated with decreased incidence of retinopathy in adults with sickle cell disease,2018,British Journal of Haematology,"Among the many vascular complications of sickle cell disease (SCD), retinopathy is the most prevalent and represents a leading cause of blindness. Hydroxycarbamide therapy ameliorates many symptoms of SCD, and high fetal haemoglobin (HbF) levels have been shown to protect against the development of retinopathy in children with HbSS. Its effect on adults with SCD, who are at a much higher risk of developing retinopathy, has not been studied. We aimed to investigate the effect of hydroxycarbamide use and HbF level on sickle cell retinopathy development in adults. We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study and collected demographics, comorbidities, and ocular and haematological data from 300 adult sickle cell subjects examined at the Henkind Eye Institute at Montefiore Medical Center during a 5-year period, from October 2012 to November 2017. The cohort was comprised mainly of Black and Hispanic subjects with all SCD genotypes, aged 18–71 years. Results show that in HbSS patients treated with hydroxycarbamide, those with retinopathy had significantly lower HbF levels compared to patients without retinopathy (P = 0·018). Our study identified the optimal HbF cut-off point for retinopathy protection to be 14·87%. Thus, a HbF level of 15% appears to be the threshold above which the odds for developing retinopathy in SS patients are reduced by 50%. © 2018 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","['hemoglobin', '  hemoglobin F', '  hydroxyurea', '  antisickling agent', '  hemoglobin F', '  adult', '  aged', '  Article', '  beta thalassemia', '  comorbidity', '  controlled study', '  cross-sectional study', '  demography', '  disease association', '  hematological parameters', '  hematology', '  hemoglobin blood level', '  human', '  major clinical study', '  priority journal', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  retinopathy', '  retrospective study', '  sickle cell anemia', '  adolescent', '  blood', '  complication', '  female', '  male', '  metabolism', '  middle aged', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  treatment outcome', '  young adult', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Aged', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Antisickling Agents', '  Cross-Sectional Studies', '  Female', '  Fetal Hemoglobin', '  Humans', '  Hydroxyurea', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retrospective Studies', '  Treatment Outcome', '  Young Adult']",7.0,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1

Methodology: This study assessed a cohort of 461 infants born between 01/01/1999 and 12/31/2012 and followed-up until 12/31/2014. Clinical events were expressed as rates for 100 patient-years, with 95% confidence intervals. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were created. Results: The median age of patients was 9.2 years; 47.5% were female. Mean values of blood tests were: hemoglobin, 10.5 g/dL; reticulocytes, 3.4%; white blood cells, 11.24 × 109/L; platelets, 337.1 × 109/L; and fetal hemoglobin, 6.3%. Clinical events: acute splenic sequestration in 14.8%, blood transfusion 23.4%, overt stroke in 0.2%. The incidence of painful vaso-occlusive episodes was 51 (48.9–53.4) per 100 patient-years and that of infections, 62.2 episodes (59.8–64.8) per 100 patient-years. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (n = 71) was normal given the current reference values for SS patients. Hydroxyurea was given to ten children, all of whom improvement of painful crises. Retinopathy was observed in 20.3% of 59 children who underwent ophthalmoscopy. Avascular necrosis was detected in seven of 12 patients evaluated, predominantly in the left femur. Echocardiogram compatible with pulmonary hypertension was recorded in 4.6% of 130 children, with an estimated average systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 33.5 mmHg. The mortality rate from all causes was 4.3%. Conclusions: Clinical severity is variable in SC hemoglobinopathy. Several children have severe manifestations similar to those with SS disease. © 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria","['antiinfective agent', '  folic acid', '  hemoglobin', '  hemoglobin F', '  hydroxyurea', '  antisickling agent', '  acute chest syndrome', '  acute otitis media', '  acute splenic sequestration crisis', '  adolescent', '  antibiotic prophylaxis', '  aplastic crisis', '  Article', '  avascular necrosis', '  basilar artery', '  blood vessel occlusion', '  bone necrosis', '  brain ischemia', '  child', '  childhood mortality', '  claudication', '  clinical assessment', '  cohort analysis', '  death', '  dehydration', '  descriptive research', '  echocardiography', '  erythrocyte transfusion', '  female', '  gait', '  gastroenteritis', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  hemorrhagic shock', '  human', '  immunization', '  incidence', '  infant', '  infection', '  infectious complication', '  laboratory test', '  leukocyte', '  lung artery pressure', '  magnetic resonance angiography', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  neuroimaging', '  newborn', '  newborn screening', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  prescription', '  priapism', '  pulmonary hypertension', '  pyrexia idiopathica', '  recurrence risk', '  reticulocyte', '  reticulocyte count', '  retinopathy', '  retrospective study', '  social behavior', '  spleen disease', '  spleen size', '  splenectomy', '  supplementation', '  thrombocyte', '  tonsillitis', '  transcranial Doppler ultrasonography', '  transesophageal echocardiography', '  transthoracic echocardiography', '  traumatic brain injury', '  upper respiratory tract infection', '  vascular disease', '  age', '  blood', '  Brazil', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  Kaplan Meier method', '  pathology', '  preschool child', '  spleen disease', '  time factor', '  Adolescent', '  Age Factors', '  Antisickling Agents', '  Brazil', '  Child', '  Child', ' Preschool', '  Female', '  Hemoglobin SC Disease', '  Humans', '  Hydroxyurea', '  Incidence', '  Infant', '  Infant', ' Newborn', '  Kaplan-Meier Estimate', '  Male', '  Neonatal Screening', '  Retrospective Studies', '  Splenic Diseases', '  Time Factors', '  Ultrasonography', ' Doppler', ' Transcranial']",5.0,Elsevier Editora Ltda,English; Portuguese,Article,['Brazil'],"[Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico, Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa, Estado de Minas Gerais]",['Brazil'],2014 - 2023,1

201,CD34+ Hematopoietic Stem Cell Count Is Predictive of Vascular Event Occurrence in Children with Sickle Cell Disease,2018,Stem Cell Reviews and Reports,"Background/Objectives: Sickle cell disease (SCD) complications mostly result from vascular dysfunction, concerning systemic microvasculature and cerebral large vessels. The aim of this cohort study was to identify potential circulating biomarkers predictive for further vascular event occurrence in pediatric SCD. Methods: We consecutively enrolled 108 children with SCD at steady state, aged 3–18 years old (median 9.8 years). Hematology, coagulation, hemolysis, endothelial, platelet and vascular activation parameters were recorded at inclusion. Neurovascular and systemic vascular events were prospectively recorded during a mean follow-up period of 27 months. Results: Patients at steady state displayed significantly higher hemolysis and platelet activation markers, higher leukocyte, CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell and microvesicle counts, and a pro-coagulant profile compared to controls matched for age and ethnicity. Circulating endothelial cell or nucleosome level did not differ. During the follow-up period, 36 patients had at least one neurovascular (n = 12) or systemic vascular event (n = 25). In a multivariate model, high CD34+ cell count was the best predictor for the occurrence of a vascular event (OR 1.2 for 1000 cell/mL increase, 95% CI [1.049–1.4], p = 0.013, sensitivity 53%, specificity 84% for a threshold of 8675 cells/mL). Conclusion: CD34+ cell count at steady state is a promising biomarker of further vascular event in children with SCD. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","['antithrombin', '  blood clotting factor 10', '  blood clotting factor 7', '  CD34 antigen', '  D dimer', '  procoagulant', '  protein C', '  protein S', '  von Willebrand factor', '  biological marker', '  CD34 antigen', '  adolescent', '  Article', '  brain ischemia', '  cell count', '  cerebral sinus thrombosis', '  cerebrovascular accident', '  child', '  echocardiography', '  endothelium cell', '  enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', '  femur head necrosis', '  follow up', '  hematology', '  hematopoietic stem cell', '  hemolysis', '  hospitalization', '  human', '  leukocyte count', '  major clinical study', '  membrane microparticle', '  nucleosome', '  preschool child', '  priority journal', '  proteinuria', '  prothrombin time', '  renovascular disease', '  retinopathy', '  school child', '  sensitivity and specificity', '  sickle cell anemia', '  systemic vascular resistance', '  thrombocyte activation', '  tricuspid valve regurgitation', '  blood', '  blood vessel', '  cerebellum', '  female', '  genetics', '  hematopoietic stem cell', '  male', '  metabolism', '  pathology', '  sickle cell anemia', '  thrombocyte', '  vascularization', '  Adolescent', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Antigens', ' CD34', '  Biomarkers', '  Blood Platelets', '  Blood Vessels', '  Cell-Derived Microparticles', '  Cerebellum', '  Child', '  Child', ' Preschool', '  Female', '  Hematopoietic Stem Cells', '  Humans', '  Male']",1.0,Humana Press Inc.,English,Article,['France'],[Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale],['France'],2014 - 2023,1
202,A review of the multifunctionality of angiopoietin-like 4 in eye disease,2018,Bioscience Reports,"Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) is a multifunctional cytokine regulating vascular permeability, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Dysregulations in these responses contribute to the pathogenesis of ischemic retinopathies such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinal vein occlusion, and sickle cell retinopathy (SCR). However, the role of ANGPTL4 in these diseases remains controversial. Here, we summarize the functional mechanisms of ANGPTL4 in several diseases. We highlight original studies that provide detailed data about the mechanisms of action for ANGPTL4, its applications as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker, and its use as a potential therapeutic target. Taken together, the discussions in this review will help us gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which ANGPTL4 functions in eye disease and will provide directions for future research. © 2018 The Author(s).","['angiopoietin related protein 4', '  biological marker', '  isoprotein', '  angiopoietin related protein 4', '  ANGPTL4 protein', ' human', '  biological marker', '  age related macular degeneration', '  angiogenesis', '  blood vessel permeability', '  branch retinal artery occlusion', '  branch retinal vein occlusion', '  carcinogenesis', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', '  eye disease', '  glucose metabolism', '  high throughput screening', '  human', '  inflammation', '  lipid metabolism', '  polymerase chain reaction', '  protein expression', '  protein function', '  protein structure', '  pterygium', '  quantitative analysis', '  retinopathy', '  Review', '  signal transduction', '  uvea melanoma', '  Western blotting', '  chemistry', '  eye disease', '  macular degeneration', '  melanoma', '  metabolism', '  molecularly targeted therapy', '  neovascularization (pathology)', '  physiology', '  uvea tumor', '  Angiopoietin-like 4 Protein', '  Biomarkers', '  Diabetic Retinopathy', '  Eye Diseases', '  Humans', '  Inflammation', '  Lipid Metabolism', '  Macular Degeneration', '  Melanoma', '  Molecular Targeted Therapy', '  Neovascularization', ' Pathologic', '  Neovascularization', ' Physiologic', '  Uveal Neoplasms']",28.0,Portland Press Ltd,English,Review,['China'],[Jilin University],['China'],2014 - 2023,1
203,Advances in the diagnosis of sickle cell retinopathy,2018,Expert Review of Ophthalmology,"Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an occlusive vascular disease that affects the vasculature of any part of the body including retina. Although the proliferative form of sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) may be more potentially damaging leading to visual impairment, non-proliferative forms too manifest changes in macula and peripheral retina. Advances in management of systemic complications of SCD have improved patient survival into adulthood with better quality of life leading to increased frequency of all ocular complications. Hence regular screening and early diagnosis of SCR is important to forestall visually significant complications of the same. Areas covered: This article gives a review of recent advances in structural and functional diagnostic imaging modalities such as spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), wide-field retinal fundus photography/angiography, OCT angiography, microperimetry, electroretinography, and multimodal imaging in assessment of SCR. A literature search was conducted on PubMed on diagnostic modalities in SCR. Considering rarity of the condition, large population studies are not available therefore articles on small studies and case series are also included. Expert opinion: Multimodal imaging allows a comprehensive evaluation of the central and peripheral features of SCR. This helps in early diagnosis of complications and timely intervention for effective management. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","['adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy', '  digital fundus fluorescein angiography', '  early diagnosis', '  electroretinography', '  human', '  indocyanine green angiography', '  multimodal imaging', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  optical coherence tomography angiography', '  perimetry', '  retinal nerve fiber layer thickness', '  retinopathy', '  Review', '  scotoma', '  screening test', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  spectral domain optical coherence tomography', '  ultra wide field fluorescein angiography']",0.0,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,English,Review,"['United Arab Emirates', ' United Kingdom']",[],['United Arab Emirates'],2014 - 2023,2
204,A comparison of 23-gauge and 20-gauge vitrectomy for proliferative sickle cell retinopathy – clinical outcomes and surgical management,2018,Eye (Basingstoke),"Aims: To report anatomical and functional outcomes in patients with proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR) who underwent 23-gauge (23G) and 20-gauge (20G) vitrectomy. Methods: Retrospective consecutive case series of patients who underwent vitreoretinal intervention for complications of PSR between April 2009 and February 2015. Operations were performed at a tertiary referral centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital. Visual acuity and anatomical success rates were evaluated for PSR complicated by retinal detachment, tractional vitreous haemorrhage and macular hole. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy cases were excluded. Results: A total of 71 eyes (63 patients) underwent vitreoretinal surgery for PSR complications with 26 months mean follow-up. Primary indications were: tractional retinal detachment (TRD, n = 17), TRD with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (n = 16), rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (n = 5, macula-on: 1, macula-off: 4), vitreous haemorrhage (n = 19), epiretinal membrane (n = 6), and full thickness macula hole (n = 8). Thirty-nine cases underwent 20G vitrectomy, and 23G surgery was performed in 32 eyes. Mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved from pre-operative 1.30 LogMAR to final BCVA of 0.74 LogMAR (p < 0.01, paired t-test). 23G vitrectomy yielded slightly better 32 vs. 25 ETDRS-letter improvement compared with 20G vitrectomy (p = 0.60, NS, unpaired t-test). 23G was associated with fewer per-operative complications (23G, 18% vs. 20G,13%). The subset of 38 eyes with retinal detachment demonstrated 79% primary reattachment rate, and a smaller BCVA improvement of 3 lines (p = 0.07, paired t-test). Conclusions: Surgical intervention for complicated PSR can preserve and/or improve vision although the degree of visual acuity stabilisation remains guarded in tractional/rhegmatogenous detachments. 23G vitrectomy may give a better functional outcome with lower per-operative complication rates. © 2018, The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.","['20 gauge vitrectomy', '  23 gauge vitrectomy', '  adolescent', '  adult', '  aged', '  Article', '  best corrected visual acuity', '  branch retinal artery occlusion', '  case study', '  clinical outcome', '  controlled study', '  epiretinal membrane', '  female', '  fibrinous uveitis', '  follow up', '  full thickness macular hole', '  human', '  hypertensive uveitis', '  intermethod comparison', '  laser coagulation', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  peroperative complication', '  platelet-rich plasma cell', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  proliferative sickle cell retinopathy', '  retina detachment', '  retina macula hole', '  retina tear', '  retrospective study', '  scatter panretinal photocoagulation', '  tractional retinal detachment', '  uveitis', '  vitrectomy', '  vitreous hemorrhage', '  complication', '  middle aged', '  pathology', '  pathophysiology', '  physiology', '  procedures', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  visual acuity', '  vitrectomy', '  young adult', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Aged', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retrospective Studies', '  Visual Acuity', '  Vitrectomy', '  Young Adult']",9.0,Nature Publishing Group,English,Article,['United Kingdom'],[NIHR Bristol Biomedical Research Centre],['United Kingdom'],2014 - 2023,1
205,Recurrent orbital bone sub-periosteal hematoma in sickle cell disease: A case study,2018,BMC Ophthalmology,"Background: Sickle cell disease is a common inherited hemoglobinopathy and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Vaso-occlusive crises commonly occur in individuals with SCD that results in high morbidity due to end-organ ischemia and infarction. These include splenic infarction, pulmonary involvement, acute chest syndrome, and orbital compression syndrome. Ocular manifestations of SCD include anterior segment ischemia, secondary glaucoma, angoid streaks, retinopathy, and retinal artery occlusion. Commonly reported causes for the incidence of sickle cell disease are extreme temperatures, wind speed, and rainfall. This study has conducted an investigation of recurrent orbital bone sub-periosteal hematoma in a sickle cell patient that was exposed to high altitude areas. Case presentation: A 12-year-old boy with SCD developed a recurrent sudden periorbital pain and swelling during a visit to high altitude area. The family reported two similar attacks previously. The patient recovered completely with timely initiated conservative treatment. The case study is about homozygous SCD with previous history of similar attack of painful periorbital swelling that resolved after conservative management. This condition was associated with proptosis, diplopia, and restriction of eye movement. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits showed right orbital roof subperiosteal mass adjacent to the orbital wall, which was identified as a subperiosteal haematoma, inducing proptosis. The patient was discharged after 7 days with follow up. Conclusions: Infarction of orbital bones during vaso-occlusive crises in SCD presented acutely with a rapidly progressive painful periorbital swelling. Hematomas frequently complicate the condition, along with the inflammatory swelling that may lead to the orbital compression syndrome. The condition is sight-threatening and necessitates prompt diagnosis along with appropriate management. This condition mandates prompt initiation of conservative treatment and close monitoring of the optic nerve functions to prevent permanent visual loss in young patients. © 2018 The Author(s).","['case report', '  child', '  complication', '  exophthalmos', '  eye pain', '  hematoma', '  human', '  male', '  orbit disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Child', '  Exophthalmos', '  Eye Pain', '  Hematoma', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Orbital Diseases']",4.0,BioMed Central Ltd.,English,Article,['Saudi Arabia'],[],['Saudi Arabia'],2014 - 2023,1

207,"The past, present and future management of sickle cell retinopathy within an African context",2018,Eye (Basingstoke),"Sickle cell retinopathy is a potentially blinding condition that affects young people in the working age group. This review looks at the past, present and future management of sickle cell retinopathy within an African context. After Sickle cell disease was first reported in 1910, some reports from Africa were pivotal in describing the retinal changes associated with the disease. It soon became obvious that there was a varied clinical picture and clinical course. Several landmark studies were carried out in Jamaica to help elucidate the complexities of the disease and outline appropriate clinical management. In most of the developed world, the clinical management of sickle cell disease has improved with concurrent improvement in outcomes. Currently resource constraints in most Sub-Saharan African countries where there is a high burden of disease means that the management of sickle cell retinopathy is fraught with numerous challenges. Future large scale trials in Africa shall hopefully help to better elucidate the mechanisms behind proliferative sickle retinopathy and help in the development of new and improved therapeutic pathways. The use of technology can help immensely in the screening of patients with sickle cell to detect early proliferative changes and if necessary treat accordingly. © 2018, The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.","['vasculotropin inhibitor', '  Africa south of the Sahara', '  African', '  clinical feature', '  developed country', '  disease burden', '  disease course', '  futurology', '  human', '  Jamaica', '  low level laser therapy', '  prevention study', '  retinopathy', '  Review', '  sickle cell anemia', '  treatment outcome', '  treatment planning', '  Africa', '  complication', '  disease management', '  morbidity', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Africa', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Disease Management', '  Humans', '  Morbidity', '  Retinal Diseases']",8.0,Nature Publishing Group,English,Review,"['United Kingdom', ' Ghana']",[],['Ghana'],2014 - 2023,2
208,Analysis of Retinal Thinning Using Spectral-domain Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging of Sickle Cell Retinopathy Eyes Compared to Age- and Race-Matched Control Eyes,2018,American Journal of Ophthalmology,"Purpose: To determine whether the retina is thinner in sickle cell patients than in race- and age-matched controls, and, if it is thinner, whether there is any association with systemic diseases. Methods: Sickle cell and control (age- and race-matched) patients were prospectively enrolled from a university retina clinic into this observational study. Participants underwent visual acuity testing, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, dilated ophthalmoscopy, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography imaging. Sickle cell retinal lesions, degree of vascular tortuosity, caliber of arteriovenous anastomosis, and stage of retinopathy were noted. Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) subfield measurements were compared between sickle cell and control subjects and also among sickle cell hemoglobin subtypes. Associations between ETDRS subfield measurements and hemoglobin subtype, retinopathy stage, and systemic diseases were assessed. Results: A total of 513 sickle cell eyes (260 patients) and 75 control eyes (39 patients) had median visual acuities of 20/20. ETDRS central (P =.002), inner (nasal P =.009, superior P =.021, temporal P <.001, inferior P =.017), and temporal outer (P =.012) subfield measurements were thinner in sickle cell eyes compared to control eyes. Hemoglobin SS eyes had significantly thinner inner ETDRS subfield measurements compared to SC and SThal eyes. Retinal thinning in all subfields was associated with age (P =.017) for sickle cell and control eyes. No association was found between retinal thinning and hydroxyurea use or arteriovenous anastomosis caliber. Conclusions: The macula is thinner in sickle cell eyes compared to control eyes; retinal thickness decreases with increasing age and sickle cell retinopathy stage and is most severe in hemoglobin SS subtypes.

209,Retinal thickness measurements in sickle cell patients with HbSS and HbSC genotype,2018,Canadian Journal of Ophthalmology,"Objective: Temporal macula thinning has been reported in sickle cell patients, but it remains unclear if there is a difference between HbSS and HbSC genotypes. We aimed to quantitatively compare macular thickness between eyes with HbSS and HbSC genotype. Design: Retrospective descriptive study. Methods: Consecutive patients seen over a 5.5-year period in the Ophthalmology Department at St Thomas’ Hospital, London, were identified. Macular optical coherence tomography images were retrospectively analyzed. The retinal thickness in all 9 subfields of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grid was compared between HbSS and HbSC eyes. Right eyes and left eyes were analyzed independently, as well as averaged measurements from both eyes. Comparison was made between the 2 genotypes, adjusting for age and sex, and for multiple testing. Scans were excluded in cases of poor fixation or ocular comorbidity affecting retinal thickness. Results: 132 HbSC and 120 HbSS patients were identified. Scans from 166 right and 153 left eyes were included (with approximately equal numbers of HbSS and HbSC genotypes). Mean retinal thickness was lower in HbSS eyes compared with HbSC eyes in all subfields of the ETDRS grid, but in most subfields the difference was <10 microns. Differences reached statistical significance for outer superior, inferior, and temporal subfields and the inner temporal subfield (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Although the HbSC genotype is more strongly associated with proliferative retinopathy, HbSS patients had on average more macular thinning. © 2018 The Authors","['hemoglobin C', '  hemoglobin S', '  hemoglobin S', '  adult', '  Article', '  comorbidity', '  controlled study', '  female', '  genotype', '  human', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  optical coherence tomography', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  retinal thickness', '  retrospective study', '  sickle cell anemia', '  blood', '  complication', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  follow up', '  genetics', '  metabolism', '  pathology', '  procedures', '  retina macula lutea', '  sickle cell anemia', '  time factor', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Diabetic Retinopathy', '  Female', '  Follow-Up Studies', '  Genotype', '  Hemoglobin', ' Sickle', '  Humans', '  Macula Lutea', '  Male', '  Retrospective Studies', '  Time Factors', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence']",9.0,Elsevier B.V.,English,Article,['United Kingdom'],"[Wellcome Trust, National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology]",['United Kingdom'],2014 - 2023,1

Demographics and pattern of presentation were recorded in the proforma prepared for the study. Results: Male:Female ratio was 3:1. About 2/3rd of the patients were below 40 years of age. Examination of posterior segment revealed 5 (10%) of the patients presented with proliferative retinopathy, 15 (30%) with non proliferative retinopathy, 13(26%) with optic disc changes, 7 (14%) with retinal macular changes and 2 (4%) had retinal detachment findings are significantly different at p=0.001 in ANOVA Test. Anterior segment of eye evaluation demonstrated significant (p=0.0001) changes 18 (36%) patients suffered conjuctival vascular changes, Cataract in 8(16%) patients, and hyphema in only 2 (4%) patients. Both anterior and posterior segment manifestations significantly (p=0.0027) increased with progressive increase in HbS window. Conclusion: Sickle cell patients need periodic ophthalmic examinations to identify treatable lesions amenable to intervention and to prevent blindness. Both anterior and posterior segment manifestations increases with progressive increase in HbS window in HbSS patients. © 2018, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

212,Correlation of Ultra-Widefield Fluorescein Angiography and OCT Angiography in Sickle Cell Retinopathy,2018,Ophthalmology Retina,"Purpose: To determine whether the degree of peripheral nonperfusion seen on ultra-widefield (UWF) fluorescein angiography (FA) correlates with measures of macular vascular flow as seen on OCT angiography (OCTA) in sickle cell retinopathy. Design: Prospective, observational study. Participants: Patients with sickle cell disease undergoing an eye examination at an urban, tertiary medical center. Methods: All patients underwent dilated fundus examination as well as UWF FA and macular OCTA imaging on the same day. The peripheral nonperfusion seen on UWF FA was measured to calculate an ischemic index (visualized nonperfusion/total visualized retinal area × 100%), and OCTA measurements of macular vessel density were recorded. The degree of peripheral nonperfusion and vessel density were then correlated. Main Outcome Measures: Correlation between ischemic index as seen on UWF FA and macular vessel density on OCTA. Results: Thirty-six eyes from 19 patients (10 women, 9 men) with a mean age of 30.8 years were included. Sickle genotypes included 14 patients with SS (73.7%), 4 with SC (21.1%), and 1 with β-thalassemia (5.2%). Average ischemic index was 4.4% for all eyes and was found to be higher in patients with sickle SC (8.0%) than in those with sickle SS (3.2%; P = 0.01). Ischemic index also was higher in those with proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (9.3%) than in those without (2.8%; P < 0.01). Ischemic index on UWF FA showed a statistically significant correlation (P < 0.05) with vessel density on OCTA in the temporal subfield of the superficial capillary plexus and in all subfields of the deep capillary plexus. Conclusions: Peripheral nonperfusion seen on UWF FA is greater in those with sickle SC disease and proliferative retinopathy and is correlated with macular vessel density on OCTA, especially the deep retinal plexus. © 2017 American Academy of Ophthalmology","['adolescent', '  adult', '  aged', '  Article', '  beta thalassemia', '  blood flow', '  capillary density', '  clinical article', '  eye fundus', '  female', '  fluorescence angiography', '  genotype', '  human', '  male', '  observational study', '  optical coherence tomography angiography', '  priority journal', '  prospective study', '  receiver operating characteristic', '  retina ischemia', '  retina macula lutea', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell', '  sickle cell retinopathy']",13.0,Elsevier Inc,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
213,Funduscopic examination and SD-OCT in detecting sickle cell retinopathy among pediatric patients,2018,Journal of AAPOS,"Purpose: To compare the results of fundus examination and spectral domain optic coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in detecting retinal changes in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease at a single center. Methods: In this prospective study, conducted over a period of 19 months, consecutive African American patients with sickle cell disease underwent complete ophthalmologic examination, and SD-OCT images of the maculas of both eyes were obtained. Results: A total of 69 (37 males) patients aged 5-20 years (mean 12.89 ± 4.09; range, 2-20) with sickle cell disease (SC, 26; SS, 36; Sβ+, 5; Sβ0 thalassemia, 2) were examined. Patients’ visual acuity range was 20/20 to 20/40. On funduscopic examination, 11 of 69 showed signs of retinopathy, whereas 47 of 68 showed inner retina thinning in the watershed zone temporal to the fovea on SD-OCT. On average, SD-OCT diagnosed disease 1.78 years earlier than fundus examination. Of patients <10 years of age, 1 was diagnosed with retinopathy by funduscopy, whereas retinal changes were evident on SD-OCT in 12 of 22. Fundus examination showed no significant difference in retinal findings between SS/Sβ0 and SC genotypes. On SD-OCT, SS/Sβ0 showed worse disease process than SC in frequency of diagnosis (82% vs 56%), bilateral involvement (87% vs 43%), and foveal involvement (18% vs 0). Conclusions: The peripheral retina could be visualized on fundus examination but not easily imaged on SD-OCT, which, however, had a higher detection rate and offered earlier diagnosis. In our patient cohort SD-OCT showed that the severity of retinal change was associated with more severe sickle cell disease genotypes (SS and Sβ0). © 2018 American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus","['adolescent', '  adult', '  African American', '  age', '  Article', '  best corrected visual acuity', '  case control study', '  child', '  cohort analysis', '  controlled study', '  disease severity', '  female', '  genotype', '  human', '  hyperpigmentation', '  hypopigmentation', '  intermethod comparison', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  priority journal', '  prospective study', '  retina fovea', '  retina hemorrhage', '  retina macula lutea', '  retinal thickness', '  retinopathy', '  sensitivity and specificity', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell beta thalassemia', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  sickle cell trait', '  spectral domain optical coherence tomography', '  visual acuity', '  comparative study', '  ethnology', '  eye fundus', '  ophthalmoscope', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  optical coherence tomography', '  physiology', '  preschool child', '  procedures', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  young adult', '  Adolescent', '  African Americans', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Case-Control Studies', '  Child', '  Child', ' Preschool', '  Female', '  Fundus Oculi', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Ophthalmoscopes', '  Ophthalmoscopy', '  Prospective Studies', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence', '  Visual Acuity', '  Young Adult']",11.0,Mosby Inc.,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
214,Retinal Findings on OCT in Systemic Conditions,2018,Seminars in Ophthalmology,"Purpose: Imaging technology has advanced by leaps and bounds in the recent past and has resulted in a much greater understanding of ocular diseases. The aim of this review article is to summarize optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings of various systemic conditions. Method: A systematic literature search of the Medline/PubMed database was performed. English articles up to April 2015 were included. Terms used for search included: Alzheimer’s Disease; Multiple Sclerosis; Parkinson’s Disease; Behçet’s Disease; Schizophrenia; Migraine; Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome; Neurofibromatosis; Sickle Cell Disease; Renal diseases; Lupus Retinopathy; Valsalva Retinopathy; Whiplash Retinopathy; Shaken-Baby Syndrome; Choroidal metastases; Intracranial Hypertension; Drug toxicity; Deferoxamine; Sildenafil; Tamoxifen; Hydroxychloroquine; Chloroquine; Ethambutol; Lead; Sickle Cell Disease; and Thalassemia along with OCT. Results: Studies have shown that inner retinal thinning could be the earliest sign of neurological diseases and may help to differentiate individuals with abnormalities. Outer retinal damage was noted in cancer-related retinopathy and secondary to drug toxicity as a diagnostic sign. This review article summarizes the OCT findings and their importance in early diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up in a varying spectrum of systemic diseases including neurological diseases, hematological diseases, cancer-related retinopathies, and systemic drug toxicity. Conclusion: OCT findings are useful to predict the probability of a disease, to diagnose it early, to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy tissue, and to assess the effect of therapeutic interventions in many systemic diseases. © Taylor & Francis.","['chloroquine', '  deferoxamine', '  ethambutol', '  hydroxychloroquine', '  lead', '  sildenafil', '  tamoxifen', '  Alzheimer disease', '  autoimmune disease', '  beta thalassemia', '  choroid cancer', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  glioma', '  hamartoma', '  hematologic disease', '  human', '  Human immunodeficiency virus infection', '  idiopathic intracranial hypertension', '  ischemic optic neuropathy', '  kidney disease', '  leukemia', '  malignant neoplasm', '  metastasis', '  migraine', '  multiple sclerosis', '  myelitis', '  myelooptic neuropathy', '  neurologic disease', '  nonhuman', '  optic nerve disease', '  optical coherence tomography', '  papilledema', '  papillitis', '  Parkinson disease', '  priority journal', '  retina disease', '  retinopathy', '  Review', '  schizophrenia', '  sickle cell anemia', '  systemic disease', '  whiplash injury', '  optical coherence tomography', '  pathology', '  pathophysiology', '  procedures', '  retina', '  retina disease', '  vision', '  Humans', '  Retina', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence', '  Vision', ' Ocular']",15.0,Taylor and Francis Ltd,English,Review,"['India', ' United States']",[],['India'],2014 - 2023,2
215,A method for age-matched OCT angiography deviation mapping in the assessment of disease- related changes to the radial peripapillary capillaries,2018,PLoS ONE,"Purpose To present a method for age-matched deviation mapping in the assessment of disease-related changes to the radial peripapillary capillaries (RPCs). Methods We reviewed 4.5x4.5mm en face peripapillary OCT-A scans of 133 healthy control eyes (133 subjects, mean 41.5 yrs, range 11–82 yrs) and 4 eyes with distinct retinal pathologies, obtained using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography angiography. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of age on RPC perfusion densities. RPC density group mean and standard deviation maps were generated for each decade of life. Deviation maps were created for the diseased eyes based on these maps. Large peripapillary vessel (LPV; noncapillary vessel) perfusion density was also studied for impact of age. Results Average healthy RPC density was 42.5±1.47%. ANOVA and pairwise Tukey-Kramer tests showed that RPC density in the 60yr group was significantly lower compared to RPC density in all younger decades of life (p<0.01). Average healthy LPV density was 21.5±3.07%. Linear regression models indicated that LPV density decreased with age, however ANOVA and pairwise Tukey-Kramer tests did not reach statistical significance. Deviation mapping enabled us to quantitatively and visually elucidate the significance of RPC density changes in disease. Conclusions It is important to consider changes that occur with aging when analyzing RPC and LPV density changes in disease. RPC density, coupled with age-matched deviation mapping techniques, represents a potentially clinically useful method in detecting changes to peripapillary perfusion in disease. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

217,Safety and efficacy of plerixafor dose escalation for the mobilization of cd34 + hematopoietic progenitor cells in patients with sickle cell disease: Interim results,2018,Haematologica,"Gene therapy for sickle cell disease is limited by the yield of hematopoietic progenitor cells that can be harvested for transduction or gene editing. We therefore performed a phase I dose-escalation study of the hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilizing agent plerixafor to evaluate the efficacy and safety of standard dosing on peripheral blood CD34 + cell mobilization. Of 15 patients enrolled to date, only one was chronically transfused and ten were on hydroxyurea. Of eight patients who achieved a CD34 + cell concentration &gt;30 cells/μL, six were on hydroxyurea. There was no clear dose response to increasing plerixafor dosage. There was a low rate of serious adverse events; two patients developed vaso-occlusive crises, at the doses of 80 μg/kg and 240 μg/kg. Hydroxyurea may have contributed to the limited CD34 + mobilization by affecting baseline peripheral blood CD34 counts, which correlated strongly with peak peripheral blood CD34 counts. Plerixafor administration did not induce significant increases in the fraction of activated neutrophils, monocytes, or platelets. However, increased neutrophils positive for activated β2 integrin and Mac-1 were associated with serious adverse events. In summary, plerixafor was well tolerated but did not achieve consistent CD34 + cell mobilization in this cohort of patients, most of whom were being actively treated with hydroxyurea and only one was chronically transfused. The study will continue with escalation of the dose of plerixafor and modification of hydroxyurea administration.

218,Retinal oxygen delivery and metabolism in healthy and sickle cell retinopathy subjects,2018,Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science,"PURPOSE. Reduction in inner retinal oxygen delivery (DO2) can cause retinal hypoxia and impair inner retinal oxygen metabolism (MO2), leading to vision loss. The purpose of the current study was to establish measurements of DO2 and MO2 in healthy subjects and test the hypothesis that DO2 and MO2 are reduced in sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) subjects. METHODS. Dual wavelength retinal oximetry and Doppler optical coherence tomography were performed in 12 healthy control and 12 SCR subjects. Images were analyzed to measure retinal arterial and venous oxygen content (O2A and O2V), venous diameter (DV), and total retinal blood flow (TRBF). Retinal arteriovenous oxygen content difference (O2AV), DO2, MO2, and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) were calculated according to the following equations: O2AV = O2A - O2V; DO2 = TRBF * O2A; MO2 = TRBF * O2AV; OEF = MO2/DO2. RESULTS. Retinal DV and TRBF were higher in the SCR group as compared to the control group, whereas, O2A, O2V, and O2AV were lower in SCR group as compared to the control group. DO2, MO2, and OEF were not significantly different between control and SCR groups. MO2 and DO2 were linearly related, such that higher MO2 was associated with higher DO2. There was an inverse relationship between TRBF and OEF, such that lower TRBF was associated with higher OEF. CONCLUSIONS. Increased blood flow compensated for decreased oxygen content, thereby maintaining DO2, MO2, and OEF at predominately lower stages of SCR. Quantitative assessment of these parameters has the potential to advance knowledge and improve diagnostic evaluation of retinal ischemic conditions. © 2018 The Authors.","['adult', '  arterial oxygen tension', '  Article', '  clinical article', '  controlled study', '  hematocrit', '  human', '  image processing', '  mean arterial pressure', '  metabolism', '  optical coherence tomography', '  oximetry', '  oxygen extraction fraction', '  oxygen therapy', '  priority journal', '  retina blood flow', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  vein diameter', '  venous oxygen tension', '  arterial pressure', '  blood', '  blood flow', '  blood flow velocity', '  female', '  male', '  normal human', '  oxygen consumption', '  pathophysiology', '  physiology', '  retina blood vessel', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  oxygen', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Arterial Pressure', '  Blood Flow Velocity', '  Female', '  Healthy Volunteers', '  Hematocrit', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Oximetry', '  Oxygen', '  Oxygen Consumption', '  Regional Blood Flow', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retinal Vessels', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence']",14.0,Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Institutes of Health, National Eye Institute, National Institute of Diabetes and, NIDDK]",['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
219,"Sickle cell maculopathy: Identification of systemic risk factors, and microstructural analysis of individual retinal layers of the macula",2018,PLoS ONE,"Purpose To identify systemic risk factors for sickle cell maculopathy, and to analyze the microstruc-ture of the macula of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) patients by using automated segmentation of individual retinal layers. Methods Thirty consecutive patients with SCD and 30 matched controls underwent spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD- OCT) and automated thickness measurement for each retinal layer; thicknesses for SCD patients were then compared to normal controls. Demographic data, systemic data, and lab results were collected for each SCD patient; multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify potential risk factors for sickle cell maculopathy. Results Ongoing chelation treatment (p = 0.0187) was the most predictive factor for the presence of sickle cell maculopathy; the odds were 94.2% lower when chelation was present. HbF level tended to influence sickle cell maculopathy (p = 0.0775); the odds decreased by 12.9% when HbF increased by 1%. Sickle cell maculopathy was detected in 43% of SCD patients as patchy areas of retinal thinning on SD- OCT thickness map, mostly located temporally to the macula, especially in eyes with more advanced forms of sickle cell retinopathy (p = 0.003). In comparison to controls, SCD patients had a subtle thinning of the overall macula and temporal retina compared to controls (most p<0.0001), involving inner and outer retinal layers. Thickening of the retinal pigment epithelium was also detected in SCD eyes (p<0.0001). Conclusions Chronic chelation therapy and, potentially, high levels of HbF are possible protective factors for the presence of sickle cell maculopathy, especially for patients with more advanced forms of sickle cell retinopathy. A subtle thinning of the overall macula occurs in SCD patients and involves multiple retinal layers, suggesting that ischemic vasculopathy May happen in both superficial and deep capillary plexi. Thinning of the outer retinal layers suggests that an ischemic insult of the choriocapillaris May also occur in SCD patients. © 2018 Dell’Arti et al.

220,"Hydroxyurea prescription, availability and use for children with sickle cell disease in Italy: Results of a National Multicenter survey",2018,Pediatric Blood and Cancer,"Background: The number of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) has increased in Italy in the past decade due to immigration. In spite of the established efficacy of hydroxyurea (HU) in childhood, population-based data regarding its prescription and effectiveness come mainly from studies performed in adults or outside Europe. Population and methods: The Hydroxyurea in SCD: A Large Nation-wide Cohort Study from Italy was a retrospective cohort study of adult and pediatric patients with SCD attending 32 centers. Pediatric data are analyzed separately. Results: Out of 504 children followed in 11 centers, 206 (40%) were on HU (194 SS/Sβ°, 12 SC/Sß+); 74% came from Sub-Saharian Africa and 18% from Europe. HU therapy indications for SS/Sβ° patients were as follows: 57% painful vaso-occlusive crisis, acute chest syndrome or both, 24% anemia, 8% anemia, and other reasons (the majority had Hb ≤ 8–8.5 g/dl, revealing scarce acceptance of low Hb values by pediatric hematologist). Mean starting dose was 15.5 mg/kg, and dose at full regimen was 17.1 mg/kg. Mean age at HU therapy was 7.68 years, although it was lower for SS/Sβ° patients. Only 10% started HU before 3 years. In 92%, 500 mg capsule was used; in 6%, the galenic was used; and in 2%, 100 mg tablet was used. Significant reduction of clinical events and inpatients admissions, with improvement in hematological parameters, was observed for SS/Sβ° patients and a trend toward improvement for SC/Sß+ patients was also observed. Conclusions: HU effectiveness is demonstrated in a national cohort of children with SCD living in Italy, even at a lower dose than recommended, revealing good adherence to a treatment program by a socially vulnerable group of patients such as immigrants. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","['hydroxyurea', '  hydroxyurea', '  acute chest syndrome', '  adolescent', '  adult', '  anemia', '  Article', '  blood transfusion', '  bone marrow transplantation', '  bone necrosis', '  brain hemorrhage', '  cerebrovascular disease', '  child', '  clinical outcome', '  cohort analysis', '  drug dose reduction', '  drug indication', '  drug use', '  erythrocyte transfusion', '  hematological parameters', '  human', '  infant', '  iron deficiency', '  iron deficiency anemia', '  leukopenia', '  major clinical study', '  patient compliance', '  prescription', '  priority journal', '  retinopathy', '  retrospective study', '  sickle cell anemia', '  thrombocytopenia', '  clinical trial', '  female', '  follow up', '  health care delivery', '  Italy', '  male', '  migrant', '  multicenter study', '  preschool child', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Adolescent', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Child', '  Child', ' Preschool', '  Drug Prescriptions', '  Emigrants and Immigrants', '  Female', '  Follow-Up Studies', '  Health Services Accessibility', '  Humans', '  Hydroxyurea', '  Infant', '  Italy', '  Male']",27.0,John Wiley and Sons Inc,English,Article,['Italy'],[Fondazione Città],['Italy'],2014 - 2023,1

222,Genetic modifiers of severity in sickle cell disease,2018,Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common single disease disorders world-wide. It is remarkable for its clinical heterogeneity, even among individuals with identical genotypes. Some individuals experience morbidity and mortality in early childhood, while others have a relatively mild course, and normal or near normal life expectancy. Many clinical complications are associated with SCD; most notably frequent pain episodes, stroke, acute chest syndrome, avascular necrosis, nephropathy, retinopathy and pulmonary hypertension. While the effects of higher fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels, UGTA1A polymorphisms, alpha-thalassemia and G6PD deficiency on SCD has been extensively studied, these variables do not explain all of the clinical heterogeneity of SCD. It is not known why some patients develop certain complications, and it is difficult to predict which complications a particular patient will experience. Much work has been done to identify genetic variants associated with these disease complications; many associations remain unvalidated. As the field continues to move beyond small sample collections and candidate gene approaches into whole genome sequencing and merging of samples from all over the world, we will identify more genetic variants associated with development of specific SCD related complications, and hopefully leverage this knowledge into targeted therapies.","['alpha thalassemia', '  complication', '  female', '  genetics', '  human', '  male', '  pathology', '  sickle cell anemia', '  alpha-Thalassemia', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Male']",15.0,,English,Article,['United States'],[National Institute of Diabetes and],[],2014 - 2023,1

We aim to describe the epidemiology of sickle retinopathy in homozygous sickle cell (SS) African patients and to analyze its association with non-ophthalmologic disease complications of sickle cell anemia. Methods: We conducted a nested study within the CADRE cohort in Cameroon. Eighty-four consecutive SS outpatients, aged 10 years and older, with no visual symptoms, underwent an ophthalmologic examination. Mean age was 23 ± 10 years. Clinical and biological features were compared between patients with and without sickle retinopathy. We compared the prevalence of the clinical complications and main biological characteristics in patients with and without sickle retinopathy using a univariate logistic regression. The same analysis was used to compare the patients with non-proliferative sickle retinopathy to those with proliferative sickle retinopathy. Statistical analyses were done using the R software (version 3.1.2). Results: Fifty-two patients (62%) displayed sickle retinopathy, among them 23 (27%) had a non-proliferative sickle retinopathy, and 29 (35%) had proliferative sickle retinopathy. Patients with proliferative sickle cell retinopathy had a mean age of 28 ± 11 years. Sickle retinopathy was associated with higher hemoglobin level (P = 0.047) and fewer leg ulcers (P = 0.018). Proliferative SR was associated with increasing age (P = 0.008) and male sex (P = 0.025) independently of the hemoglobin level. Conclusions: Sickle retinopathy is particularly frequent in sub-Saharan sickle cell SS patients, which advocates for early systematic screening. © 2017","['adolescent', '  adult', '  Africa south of the Sahara', '  Cameroon', '  child', '  chronic disease', '  cohort analysis', '  complication', '  female', '  human', '  male', '  middle aged', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  young adult', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Africa South of the Sahara', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Cameroon', '  Child', '  Chronic Disease', '  Cohort Studies', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Young Adult']",1.0,Elsevier Masson SAS,English; French,Article,"['Cameroon', ' France', ' South Africa']",[],['Cameroon'],2014 - 2023,3

One of the most common is sickle cell anemia, which, due to sickling of erythrocytes, causes vaso-occlusive phenomena. Among the possible ocular manifestations, the most representative is retinopathy, which can lead to blindness if left untreated.

226,Sickle cell disease and the eye,2017,Current Opinion in Ophthalmology,"Purpose of review To review recent literature pertaining to sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) and, in particular, sickle cell maculopathy. Recent findings Several recent studies suggest that macular perfusion abnormalities seen in patients with sickle cell disease of various genotypes may affect both the superficial and deep capillary plexi, with a predilection for the deep capillary plexus. Further, these changes may be associated with areas of macular thinning, as well as with peripheral retinal ischemia, even in individuals without visual symptoms, contrary to what has previously been described in both diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion. Several cases also suggest that paracentral acute middle maculopathy may be the pathophysiologic mechanism by which microvascular occlusion leads to macular thinning. Summary Sickle cell disease can manifest in a number of ways within the orbit as well as intraocularly because of its nonspecific vasoocclusive episodes. However, SCR is the most common ophthalmic manifestation of this disease. Historically, SCR has been considered a peripheral retinopathy, but the development and use of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and optical coherence tomography angiography suggest that significant macular vascular changes occur early in this disease, even in asymptomatic individuals.

227,Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography and Ultra-widefield Fluorescein Angiography for Early Detection of Adolescent Sickle Retinopathy,2017,American Journal of Ophthalmology,"Purpose Based on standard screening techniques, sickle retinopathy reportedly occurs in 10% of adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD). We performed a prospective, observational clinical study to determine if ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWFA), spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) detect more-frequent retinopathy in adolescents with SCD. Design Cross-sectional study. Methods SETTING: Institutional. SUBJECTS: Sixteen adolescents with SCD, aged 10–19 years (mean age 14.9 years), and 5 age-equivalent controls (mean age 17.4 years). OBSERVATION PROCEDURES: Examinations including acuity, standard slit-lamp biomicroscopy, UWFA, SD-OCT, and OCT-A were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sickle retinopathy defined by biomicroscopic changes, Goldberg stages I-V, Penman scale, flow void on OCT-A, or macular thinning on SD-OCT. Results While 22 of 32 SCD eyes (68.8%) had retinopathy on biomicroscopy, by UWFA 4 of 24 (16.7%) SCD eyes had peripheral arterial occlusion (Goldberg I), and 20 of 24 eyes (83.3%) had peripheral arteriovenous anastomoses (Goldberg II) in addition. No patients had Goldberg stages III-V. By SD-OCT and OCT-A, thinning of the macula and flow voids in both the superficial and deep retinal capillary plexus were found in 6 of 30 (20%) eyes. Conclusions All 24 eyes with adequate UWFA studies demonstrated sickle retinopathy. SD-OCT and OCT-A, which have not been previously reported in the adolescent population, detected abnormal macular thinning and flow abnormalities undetected by biomicroscopy. These findings suggest that pediatric sickle retinopathy may be more prevalent than previously suspected. If these findings are confirmed with larger cross-sectional and prospective analyses, these approaches may enhance early screening for sickle retinopathy. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","['adolescent', '  artery occlusion', '  Article', '  biomicroscopy', '  controlled study', '  cross-sectional study', '  fluorescence angiography', '  human', '  observational study', '  optical coherence tomography angiography', '  optical coherence tomography angiography device', '  priority journal', '  prospective study', '  retina capillary', '  retina macula lutea', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  spectral domain optical coherence tomography', '  blood flow', '  child', '  complication', '  eye fundus', '  female', '  fluorescence angiography', '  follow up', '  male', '  optical coherence tomography', '  pathology', '  pathophysiology', '  procedures', '  reproducibility', '  retina', '  retina blood vessel', '  Retinal Diseases', '  sickle cell anemia', '  young adult', '  Adolescent', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Child', '  Cross-Sectional Studies', '  Female', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Follow-Up Studies', '  Fundus Oculi', '  Humans', '  Macula Lutea', '  Male', '  Prospective Studies', '  Regional Blood Flow', '  Reproducibility of Results', '  Retina', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retinal Vessels', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence', '  Young Adult']",34.0,Elsevier Inc.,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Heart, Blood Institute, National Eye Institute, RPB, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, UL1TR001873]",['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
228,The application of optical coherence tomography angiography in retinal diseases,2017,Survey of Ophthalmology,"Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a new, noninvasive imaging technique that generates real-time volumetric data on chorioretinal vasculature and its flow pattern. With the advent of high-speed optical coherence tomography, established en face chorioretinal segmentation, and efficient algorithms, OCTA generates images that resemble an angiogram. The principle of OCTA involves determining the change in backscattering between consecutive B-scans and then attributing the differences to the flow of erythrocytes through retinal blood vessels. OCTA has shown promise in the evaluation of common ophthalmologic diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and retinal vascular occlusions. It quantifies vascular compromise reflecting the severity of diabetic retinopathy. OCTA detects the presence of choroidal neovascularization in exudative age-related macular degeneration and maps loss of choriocapillaris in nonexudative age-related macular degeneration. We describe principles of OCTA and findings in common and some uncommon retinal pathologies. Finally, we summarize its potential future applications. Its current limitations include a relatively small field of view, inability to show leakage, and a tendency for image artifacts. Further larger studies will define OCTAs utility in clinical settings and establish if the technology may offer its utility in decreasing morbidity through early detection and guide therapeutic interventions in retinal diseases. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","['vasculotropin inhibitor', '  age related macular degeneration', '  Article', '  artifact', '  B scan', '  central serous retinopathy', '  choroid capillary layer', '  diabetic macular edema', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  fluorescence angiography', '  foveal avascular zone', '  fundus fluorescein angiography', '  geographic atrophy', '  human', '  laser coagulation', '  macular telangiectasia', '  multimodal imaging', '  myopia', '  optical coherence tomography', '  optical coherence tomography angiography', '  polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy', '  priority journal', '  proliferative diabetic retinopathy', '  radiation retinopathy', '  retina artery occlusion', '  retina disease', '  retina dystrophy', '  retina vein occlusion', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  spectral domain optical coherence tomography', '  subretinal neovascularization', '  visual system parameters', '  wet macular degeneration', '  capillary', '  diagnostic imaging', '  fluorescence angiography', '  fluorescence imaging', '  pathology', '  procedures', '  retina blood vessel', '  retina disease', '  retina ganglion cell', '  three dimensional imaging', '  Capillaries', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Humans', '  Imaging', ' Three-Dimensional', '  Optical Imaging', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retinal Ganglion Cells', '  Retinal Vessels', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence']",86.0,Elsevier USA,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1

230,Prospective evaluation of chronic organ damage in adult sickle cell patients: A seven-year follow-up study,2017,American Journal of Hematology,"Organ damage in sickle cell disease (SCD) is a crucial determinant for disease severity and prognosis. In a previous study, we analyzed the prevalence of SCD-related organ damage and complications in adult sickle cell patients. We now describe a seven-year follow-up of this cohort.All patients from the primary analysis in 2006 (n = 104), were included for follow-up. Patients were screened for SCD-related organ damage and complications (microalbuminuria, renal failure, elevated tricuspid regurgitation flow velocity (TRV) (≥2.5 m/seconds), retinopathy, iron overload, cholelithiasis, avascular osteonecrosis, leg ulcers, acute chest syndrome (ACS), stroke, priapism and admissions for vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) biannually. Upon 7 years of follow-up, progression in the prevalence of avascular osteonecrosis (from 12.5% to 20.4%), renal failure (from 6.7% to 23.4%), retinopathy (from 39.7% to 53.8%) was observed in the whole group. In HbSS/HbSβ0-thal patients also progression in microalbuminuria (from 34% to 45%) and elevated TRV (from 40% to 48%) was observed while hardly any progression in the prevalence of cholelithiasis, priapism, stroke or chronic ulcers was seen. The proportion of patients with at least one episode of ACS increased in the group of HbSS/HbSβ0-thal patients from 32% to 49.1%. In conclusion, 62% of the sickle cell patients in this prospective cohort study developed a new SCD-related complication in a comprehensive care setting within 7 years of follow-up. Although the hospital admission rate for VOC remained stable, multiple forms of organ damage increased substantially. These observations underline the need for continued screening for organ damage in all adult patients with SCD. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","['acute chest syndrome', '  adult', '  Article', '  avascular necrosis', '  cerebrovascular accident', '  cholelithiasis', '  chronic disease', '  disease course', '  female', '  flow rate', '  genotype', '  human', '  iron overload', '  kidney failure', '  leg ulcer', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  microalbuminuria', '  prevalence', '  priapism', '  priority journal', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  tissue injury', '  tricuspid valve regurgitation', '  ulcer', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Arterial Occlusive Diseases', '  blood', '  cholelithiasis', '  complication', '  cross-sectional study', '  follow up', '  hospitalization', '  Kaplan Meier method', '  Kidney Diseases', '  middle aged', '  mortality', '  prospective study', '  Retinal Diseases', '  statistics and numerical data', '  Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Arterial Occlusive Diseases', '  Cholelithiasis', '  Cross-Sectional Studies', '  Female', '  Follow-Up Studies', '  Genotype', '  Hospitalization', '  Humans', '  Kaplan-Meier Estimate', '  Kidney Diseases', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Prevalence', '  Prospective Studies', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency']",25.0,Wiley-Liss Inc.,English,Article,['Netherlands'],[],['Netherlands'],2014 - 2023,1
231,A major review of optical coherence tomography angiography,2017,Expert Review of Ophthalmology,"Introduction: Recent innovations in ophthalmic imaging have led to new alternatives to conventional ocular angiography. We describe different methods of label-free angiography and their clinical utility in ophthalmic practice. Areas covered: The aim of this paper is to review the current literature on Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA). A review of the literature was performed, including the physical principles and algorithms and OCTA features of different ocular diseases. The literature reviewed was found by searching Pubmed and Google Scholar for optical coherence tomography, OCT angiography, and label-free angiography. All results in the English language were read in full-text. Expert commentary: OCTA is an emerging, non-invasive imaging modality which can display ocular vasculature with good sensitivity and may help us detect vascular disorders of the retina and choroid. The technique’s depth-resolving ability allows us to localize the origin of several disorders to the individual vascular networks of retina and choroid. In practice, OCTA can provide vascular details comparable to or better than current gold-standard, vascular imaging techniques and may be repeated and reproduced frequently without any significant complications. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","['age related macular degeneration', '  aneurysm', '  central serous retinopathy', '  clinical feature', '  clinical practice', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  disease classification', '  eye examination', '  fluorescence angiography', '  fundus fluorescein angiography', '  human', '  image analysis', '  indocyanine green angiography', '  intermethod comparison', '  macular telangiectasia type 2', '  non invasive procedure', '  optical coherence tomography angiography', '  polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy', '  retina artery occlusion', '  retina disease', '  retina vein occlusion', '  retinal arterial macroaneurysm', '  retinal telangiectasia', '  retinopathy', '  Review', '  sensitivity analysis', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  signal transduction', '  uveitis', '  Vogt Koyanagi syndrome']",16.0,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,English,Review,"['Pakistan', ' United States']",[],['Pakistan'],2014 - 2023,2

This study is to demonstrate computer-aided SCR classification using quantitative OCTA features, i.e., blood vessel tortuosity (BVT), blood vessel diameter (BVD), vessel perimeter index (VPI), foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, FAZ contour irregularity, parafoveal avascular density (PAD). It was observed that combined features show improved classification performance, compared to single feature. Three classifiers, including support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm, and discriminant analysis, were evaluated. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were quantified to assess the performance of each classifier. For SCR vs. control classification, all three classifiers performed well with an average accuracy of 95% using the six quantitative OCTA features.

235,Association of plasma CD40L with acute chest syndrome in sickle cell anemia,2017,Cytokine,"Platelet activation and platelet-derived cytokines contribute to the vascular inflammation and increased thrombotic activity known to occur in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). CD40 ligand (CD40L), a platelet-associated pro-inflammatory molecule that promotes endothelial cell activation, is elevated in the circulation of SCA patients. We sought to evaluate the association of CD40L and inflammation with sickle-related clinical complications and laboratory variables in SCA patients. Soluble CD40L, thrombospondin (TSP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were determined in the platelet-poor plasma of healthy individuals and steady-state SCA patients by ELISA. Lifetime clinical complications were verified by detailed review of patients’ medical records. We found that plasma CD40L was associated with acute chest syndrome (ACS), and that SCA patients with a lifetime history of ACS (ACS+) presented significantly higher plasma CD40L and TSP-1 than patients who had never experienced ACS (ACS−). In the ACS+ group, both platelet-derived proteins (CD40L and TSP-1) correlated with mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin and reticulocyte hemoglobin, while in the ACS− group, CD40L correlated with low red blood cell counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit and lactate dehydrogenase, and TSP-1 correlated with reticulocyte percentage and white blood cell count. As expected, CD40L and TSP-1 correlated with platelet counts in both groups. These data highlight the possible role of platelet activation in ACS and suggest that plasma sCD40L, together with TSP-1, may represent a potential marker of susceptibility to ACS in SCA. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","['CD40 ligand', '  hemoglobin', '  lactate dehydrogenase', '  thrombospondin 1', '  tumor necrosis factor', '  biological marker', '  CD40 ligand', '  thrombospondin 1', '  tumor necrosis factor', '  acute chest syndrome', '  adult', '  Article', '  bone necrosis', '  cerebrovascular accident', '  cohort analysis', '  controlled study', '  correlation analysis', '  disease association', '  disease predisposition', '  enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', '  erythrocyte count', '  female', '  hematocrit', '  hemoglobin blood level', '  hemolysis', '  human', '  lactate dehydrogenase blood level', '  leukocyte count', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  mean corpuscular hemoglobin', '  mean corpuscular volume', '  medical record review', '  priapism', '  priority journal', '  protein blood level', '  reticulocyte', '  reticulocyte hemoglobin content', '  retinopathy', '  retrospective study', '  sickle cell anemia', '  steady state', '  thrombocyte activation', '  thrombocyte count', '  acute chest syndrome', '  adolescent', '  blood', '  complication', '  inflammation', '  medical record', '  middle aged', '  pathophysiology', '  platelet count', '  sickle cell anemia', '  young adult', '  Acute Chest Syndrome', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Biomarkers', '  CD40 Ligand', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Inflammation', '  Male', '  Medical Records', '  Middle Aged', '  Platelet Activation', '  Platelet Count', '  Thrombospondin 1', '  Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', '  Young Adult']",17.0,Academic Press,English,Article,"['Brazil', ' United Kingdom', ' United States']","[Medical Research Council, G0000111, Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa]",['Brazil'],2014 - 2023,3
236,Prevalence and risk factors for sickle retinopathy in a sub-Saharan comprehensive Sickle Cell Center [Prévalence et facteurs de risque de la rétinopathie drépanocytaire dans un centre de suivi drépanocytaire d'Afrique subsaharienne],2017,Revue de Medecine Interne,"Introduction Retinopathy is a chronic complication with severe functional consequences in patients with sickle cell disease. Its prevalence is not well known in sub-Saharan Africa because of the absence of screening. We report here the results of a routine screening for sickle retinopathy in a Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center in Sub-Saharan Africa. Methods Screening of sickle retinopathy was carried out in all sickle cell patients aged 10 and over, followed between 2010 and 2012. Retinopathy was screened by dilated indirect fundoscopic examination and retinal angiography, if necessary. The gender, age and hematological parameters of patients with sickle retinopathy were compared with those of controls randomly selected from the cohort of sickle cell patients without retinopathy followed during the same period. Results The overall prevalence of sickle cell retinopathy was 8.8% (142/1604): 12.4% (91/731) in SC, 5.2% (38/734) in SS, 9.4% (5/53) in Sβ°-thalassemia patients and 9.3% (8/86) in Sβ+-thalassemia patients. Proliferative retinopathy was more common in SC patients (P &lt; 0.01). High levels of hemoglobin or of hematocrit were associated with retinopathy in all patients and with proliferative retinopathy in SC patients. In SS or Sβ0thalassemia patients, high leukocyte count was associated with proliferative retinopathy. Low fetal hemoglobin level was associated with retinopathy in all groups. Conclusion The prevalence of sickle cell retinopathy is high and negatively associated to the level of fetal hemoglobin. The efficiency of a routine screening for sickle cell retinopathy must be assessed in Africa as well as the benefit of phlebotomy and hydroxyurea therapy as a preventive treatments. © 2017 Société Nationale Française de Médecine Interne (SNFMI)","['hemoglobin', '  Article', '  child', '  controlled study', '  hematocrit', '  human', '  leukocyte count', '  major clinical study', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  prevalence', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  retina angiography', '  retinopathy', '  risk factor', '  screening test', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell beta thalassemia', '  sickle retinopathy', '  adolescent', '  adult', '  Africa south of the Sahara', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  complication', '  female', '  hospital', '  male', '  Retinal Diseases', '  young adult', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Africa South of the Sahara', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Female', '  Hospitals', ' Special', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Prevalence', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Risk Factors', '  Young Adult']",11.0,Elsevier Masson SAS,English; French,Article,"['France', ' Mali']",[],[],2014 - 2023,2
237,Sickle cell retinopathy: Improving care with a multidisciplinary approach,2017,Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare,"Sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) is the most representative ophthalmologic complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), a hemoglobinopathy affecting both adults and children. SCR presents a wide spectrum of manifestations and may even lead to irreversible vision loss if not properly diagnosed and treated at the earliest. Over the past decade, multidisciplinary research developments have focused upon systemic, genetic, and ocular risk factors of SCR, enabling the clinician to better diagnose and manage these patients. In addition, newer imaging and testing modalities, such as spectral domain-optical coherence tomography angiography, have resulted in the detection of subclinical retinopathy related to SCD. Innovative therapy includes intravitreal injection of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (eg, Lucentis® [ranibizumab] or Eylea® [aflibercept]) which appears comparatively safe and efficient, and may be combined with laser photocoagulation (LPC) for proliferative SCR. The effect of LPC alone does not significantly lead to the regression of advanced SCR, although it helps in avoiding hemorrhage and sight loss. This comprehensive article is based on 10-years retrospective (2007-2017) studies. It aims to present advances and recommendations in SCR theranostics while pointing out the requirement of combinatorial approaches for better management of SCR patients. To reach this goal, we identified and analyzed randomized original and review articles, clinical trials, non-randomized intervention studies, and observational studies using specified keywords in various databases (eg, Medline, Embase, Cochrane, ClinicalTrials.gov). © 2017 Menaa et al.","['aflibercept', '  bevacizumab', '  deferasirox', '  deferoxamine mesylate', '  defrijet', '  hydroxyurea', '  placebo', '  ranibizumab', '  rasiroxpine', '  blood transfusion', '  disease classification', '  disease severity', '  drug efficacy', '  drug safety', '  eye surgery', '  genetic risk', '  human', '  hyphema', '  laser coagulation', '  multicenter study (topic)', '  nonhuman', '  pathogenesis', '  phase 3 clinical trial (topic)', '  randomized controlled trial (topic)', '  retinopathy', '  Review', '  sickle cell', '  sickle cell anemia', '  spectral domain optical coherence tomography']",16.0,Dove Medical Press Ltd.,English,Review,"['France', ' Pakistan', ' United States']",[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,3
238,"Expression of the angiogenic mediator, angiopoietin-like 4, in the eyes of patients with proliferative sickle retinopathy",2017,PLoS ONE,"The recent success of therapies directly targeting the angiogenic mediator, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), for the treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy has encouraged clinicians to extend the use of anti-VEGF therapies for the treatment of another ischemic retinal vascular disease, proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (PSR), the most common cause of irreversible blindness in patients with sickle cell disease. However, results from case reports evaluating anti-VEGF therapies for PSR have been mixed. This highlights the need to identify alternative therapeutic targets for the treatment of retinal neovascularization in sickle cell patients. In this regard, angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) is a novel angiogenic factor regulated by the transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1, the master regulator of angiogenic mediators (including VEGF) in ischemic retinal disease. In an effort to identify alternative targets for the treatment of sickle cell retinopathy, we have explored the expression of ANGPTL4 in the eyes of patients with PSR. To this end, we examined expression and localization of ANGPTL4 by immunohistochemistry in autopsy eyes from patients with known PSR (n = 5 patients). Complementary studies were performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in aqueous (n = 8; 7 patients, 2 samples from one eye of same patient) and vitreous (n = 3 patients) samples from a second group of patients with active PSR. We detected expression of ANGPTL4 in neovascular tissue and in the ischemic inner retina in PSR, but not control, eyes. We further observed elevated expression of ANGPTL4 in the aqueous and vitreous of PSR patients compared to controls. These results suggest that ANGPTL4 could contribute to the development of retinal neovascularization in sickle cell patients and could therefore be a therapeutic target for the treatment of PSR. © 2017 Jee et al.

239,Method for quantitative assessment of retinal vessel tortuosity in optical coherence tomography angiography applied to sickle cell retinopathy,2017,Biomedical Optics Express,"Tortuosity is an important geometric vessel parameter and among the first microvascular alterations observed in various retinopathies. In the current study, a quantitative vessel tortuosity index (VTI) based on a combination of local and global centerline features is presented. Performance of VTI and previously established tortuosity indices were compared against human observers’ evaluation of tortuosity. An image-processing pipeline was developed for application of VTI in retinal vessels imaged by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in perifoveal (6 mm × 6 mm) and parafoveal (3 mm × 3 mm) regions centered on the fovea. Forty-one subjects (12 healthy control (NC) and 29 sickle cell retinopathy (SCR)) and 10 subjects (5 NC and 5 SCR) were imaged in the perifoveal and parafoveal regions, respectively. The relationship between VTI and age was examined in the perifoveal regions in NC subjects. VTI was measured from the OCTA images and compared between NC and SCR subjects using generalized least square regression with and without adjusting for age and race. VTI was found to correlate better than the 4 previous indices with performance of human observers. In the perifoveal region, a significant correlation was observed between VTI and age (r = −0.4, P<0.001, N = 12). VTI was higher in SCR than NC subjects in perifoveal and parafoveal regions (P≤0.001). The results demonstrate that the proposed method shows promise for detection of increased tortuosity in vessels due to retinal disorders. © 2017 Optical Society of America.","['Angiography', '  Eye protection', '  Medical imaging', '  Ophthalmology', '  Optical data processing', '  Optical tomography', '  Pipeline processing systems', '  Tomography', '  Medical and biological imaging', '  Retina', '  Sickle cell', '  Tortuosity', '  Vessel', '  Image processing', '  adolescent', '  adult', '  age', '  Article', '  clinical article', '  controlled study', '  female', '  frequency', '  human', '  image analysis', '  image processing', '  male', '  mathematical parameters', '  measurement', '  optical coherence tomography angiography', '  optical coherence tomography device', '  quantitative analysis', '  retina blood vessel', '  retina fovea', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  vessel tortuosity index', '  vision', '  visual system parameters']",29.0,OSA - The Optical Society,English,Article,['United States'],[RPB],[],2014 - 2023,1
240,National registry of hemoglobinopathies in Spain (REPHem),2017,Pediatric Blood and Cancer,"Background: Although highly prevalent throughout the world, the accurate prevalence of hemoglobinopathies in Spain is unknown. Procedure: This study presents data on the national registry of hemoglobinopathies of patients with thalassemia major (TM), thalassemia intermedia (TI), and sickle cell disease (SCD) in Spain created in 2014. Fifty centers reported cases retrospectively. Data were registered from neonatal screening or from the first contact at diagnosis until last follow-up or death. Results: Data of the 715 eligible patients were collected: 615 SCD (497 SS, 64 SC, 54 SBeta phenotypes), 73 thalassemia, 9 CC phenotype, and 18 other variants. Most of the SCD patients were born in Spain (65%), and 51% of these were diagnosed at newborn screening. Median age at the first diagnosis was 0.4 years for thalassemia and 1.0 years for SCD. The estimated incidence was 0.002 thalassemia cases and 0.03 SCD cases/1,000 live births. Median age was 8.9 years (0.2–33.7) for thalassemia and 8.1 years (0.2–32.8) for SCD patients. Stroke was registered in 16 SCD cases. Transplantation was performed in 43 TM and 23 SCD patients at a median age of 5.2 and 7.8 years, respectively. Twenty-one patients died (3 TM, 17 SCD, 1 CC) and 200 were lost to follow-up. Causes of death were related to transplantation in three patients with TM and three patients with SCD. Death did not seem to be associated with SCD in six patients, but nine patients died secondary to disease complications. Overall survival was 95% at 15 years of age. Conclusions: The registry provides data about the prevalence of hemoglobinopathies in Spain and will permit future cohort studies and the possibility of comparison with other registries. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","['colecalciferol', '  deferasirox', '  deferiprone', '  acute chest syndrome', '  adolescent', '  adult', '  alloimmunization', '  aplasia', '  Article', '  bone necrosis', '  cerebrovascular accident', '  chelation therapy', '  child', '  cholelithiasis', '  cross-sectional study', '  female', '  fever', '  follow up', '  growth retardation', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  human', '  hyperhemolysis syndrome', '  hypertension', '  hypoxemia', '  incidence', '  infant', '  kidney disease', '  liver hemosiderosis', '  lung disease', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  meningitis', '  multicenter study', '  newborn screening', '  observational study', '  osteomyelitis', '  osteopenia', '  overall survival', '  phenotype', '  prevalence', '  priapism', '  priority journal', '  pulmonary hypertension', '  retinopathy', '  retrospective study', '  right upper quadrant syndrome', '  sepsis', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Spain', '  thalassemia intermedia', '  thalassemia major', '  vein occlusion', '  Hemoglobinopathies', '  newborn', '  preschool child', '  register', '  Child', '  Child', ' Preschool', '  Female', '  Hemoglobinopathies', '  Humans', '  Infant', '  Infant', ' Newborn', '  Male', '  Prevalence', '  Registries', '  Spain']",30.0,John Wiley and Sons Inc.,English,Article,['Spain'],[],['Spain'],2014 - 2023,1

242,Evidence from a natural experiment that malaria parasitemia is pathogenic in retinopathy-negative cerebral malaria,2017,eLife,"Cerebral malaria (CM) can be classified as retinopathy-positive or retinopathy-negative, based on the presence or absence of characteristic retinal features. While malaria parasites are considered central to the pathogenesis of retinopathy-positive CM, their contribution to retinopathy-negative CM is largely unknown. One theory is that malaria parasites are innocent bystanders in retinopathy-negative CM and the etiology of the coma is entirely non-malarial. Because hospitals in malaria-endemic areas often lack diagnostic facilities to identify non-malarial causes of coma, it has not been possible to evaluate the contribution of malaria infection to retinopathy-negative CM. To overcome this barrier, we studied a natural experiment involving genetically inherited traits, and find evidence that malaria parasitemia does contribute to the pathogenesis of retinopathy-negative CM. A lower bound for the fraction of retinopathy-negative CM that would be prevented if malaria parasitemia were to be eliminated is estimated to be 0.93 (95% confidence interval: 0.68, 1). © Small et al.","['Article', '  brain size', '  breathing rate', '  bystander effect', '  cerebral malaria', '  child', '  controlled study', '  female', '  genotype', '  human', '  leukocyte count', '  male', '  null hypothesis', '  parasitemia', '  physical examination', '  pulse rate', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell trait', '  cerebral malaria', '  complication', '  infant', '  Malawi', '  pathology', '  pathophysiology', '  preschool child', '  Child', '  Child', ' Preschool', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Infant', '  Malaria', ' Cerebral', '  Malawi', '  Male', '  Parasitemia']",16.0,eLife Sciences Publications Ltd,English,Article,"['United Kingdom', ' Malawi', ' United States']","[the National Institutes of Health, FNIH, Wellcome Trust, Medical Research Council]",['United States'],2014 - 2023,3
243,Gas Tamponade for Retinectomy in PVR-Related Retinal Detachments: A Retrospective Study,2017,Ophthalmology and Therapy,"Introduction: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the anatomical and functional results in patients with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) treated with retinectomy and perfluoro-octane gas (C3F8) as a tamponade agent. Methods: 12 patients with inferior and anterior complicated PVR-related retinal detachment, who were treated with retinectomy, where C3F8 was used as the tamponade agent were examined. Primary outcome was the anatomical success, while visual acuity, existence of an epiretinal membrane (ERM) and intraocular pressure (IOP) postoperatively were secondary outcomes. Results: The primary success rate was 75% (mean follow-up of 9.8 months). Reoperation was needed on 25% of patients after the retinectomy procedure. Preoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was poor due to macular involvement in all cases. BCVA was improved in three patients (25%), remained stable in 25% and deteriorated in 16.7%. Two patients were lost during the follow-up period. Postoperative ERM formation was noted in 33.3% of patients. One patient developed hypotony, while no other complications were observed. Conclusion: Retinectomy with C3F8 as the tamponade agent provides anatomical and functional restoration at a 75% primary success rate in PVR-related retinal detachment. © 2017, The Author(s).","['perfluorodecalin', '  perfluorooctane', '  Article', '  best corrected visual acuity', '  clinical article', '  comorbidity', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  diathermy', '  endolaser', '  epiretinal membrane', '  female', '  human', '  intraocular hypotension', '  intraocular pressure', '  male', '  polyglactin suture', '  postoperative care', '  priority journal', '  reoperation', '  retina detachment', '  retina surgery', '  retinectomy', '  retrospective study', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  treatment outcome', '  vitreoretinopathy']",2.0,Springer Healthcare,English,Article,['United Kingdom'],[],['United Kingdom'],2014 - 2023,1
244,Ocular manifestations of sickle cell disease and genetic susceptibility for refractive errors,2017,Taiwan Journal of Ophthalmology,"Purpose: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common and serious form of an inherited blood disorder that lead to higher risk of early mortality. SCD patients are at high risk for developing multiorgan acute and chronic complications linked with significant morbidity and mortality. Some of the ophthalmological complications of SCD include retinal changes, refractive errors, vitreous hemorrhage, and abnormalities of the cornea. Materials and Methods: The present study includes 96 SCD patients. A dilated comprehensive eye examination was performed to know the status of retinopathy. Refractive errors were measured in all patients. In patients with >10 years of age, cycloplegia was not performed before autorefractometry. A subset of fifty patients' genotyping was done for NOS3 27-base pair (bp) variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) and IL4 intron-3 VNTR polymorphisms using polymerase chain reaction-electrophoresis. Chi-square test was performed to test the association between the polymorphisms and refractive errors. Results: The results of the present study revealed that 63.5% of patients have myopia followed by 19.8% hyperopia. NOS3 27-bp VNTR genotypes significantly deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P < 0.0001). Although IL4 70-bp VNTR increased the risk of developing refractive errors, it is not statistically significant. However, NOS3 27-bp VNTR significantly reduced the risk of development of myopia. Conclusion : In summary, our study documents the prevalence of refractive errors along with some retinal changes in Indian SCD patients. Further, this study demonstrates that the NOS3 VNTR contributes to the susceptibility to development of myopia in SCD cases. © 2017 Taiwan J Ophthalmol | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",,6.0,Medknow Publications,English,Article,['India'],[],['India'],2014 - 2023,1
245,Electroretinogram Findings in Early-Stage Sickle Cell Retinopathy According to Hemoglobin Type,2017,Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science,"PURPOSE. Although extensive clinical research has been performed on structural analysis of sickle cell (SC) retinopathy, functional aspects have been poorly investigated. Our purpose was to report full-field electroretinogram (ffERG) findings in patients with early SC retinopathy according to the following hemoglobin types: HbSS or HbSC (homozygous or heterozygous mutations, respectively). METHODS. In this monocentric retrospective observational study, patients affected by nonproliferative SC retinopathy were included from November 2014 to April 2016. Patients were separated into one of the following three groups: HbSS, HbSC, and control. All groups underwent full ophthalmologic examination (fundus examination) and ffERG. For SC patients, additional imaging testing was also performed (fluorescein angiography and spectral domain optical coherence tomography). RESULTS. A total of 24 eyes from 12 patients (6 HbSS and 6 HbSC) and 12 eyes from 6 controls were included. The HbSS group exhibited a dramatic decrease of the b-wave amplitudes for all dark-adapted (DA) ffERG responses when compared with the control group (P ¼ 0.02, P ¼ 0.003, P ¼ 0.005, respectively, after DA 0.01, DA 3.0, and DA 10.0 cd.s.m-2 stimulations) and decreased a-wave amplitudes for light-adapted responses (P ¼ 0.03 after light-adapted 3.0 cd.s.m-2 stimulations). The a-Wave amplitudes were significantly reduced for all dark-adapted and light-adapted responses in HbSC group compared to the control group (P ¼ 0.03, P ¼ 0.01, P ¼ 0.03, respectively, after DA 3.0, DA 10.0, and light-adapted 3.0 cd.s.m-2 stimulations). The HbSSþHbSC groups presented decreased a-wave amplitudes for DA and light-adapted responses and decreased b-wave amplitude after DA 0.01 and 10.0 cd.s.m-2 stimulations when compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS. These results could suggest an early involvement of the inner retinal cells in the disease process in HbSS patients and of the outer retinal cells in HbSC patients. This could provide new insights on the pathophysiology of the retinal affection in HbSS/HbSC SC disease.

246,Clinical and laboratory predictors of frequency of painful crises among sickle cell anaemia patients in Nigeria,2017,Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research,"Introduction: The severity of Sickle Cell Anaemia (SCA) in terms of frequency of painful Vaso-Occlusive Crises (VOC) may be affected by clinical and haematological parameters amongst others. Elucidation of these factors in a given disease prevalent environment is necessary for prompt and effective management of patients with frequent painful VOC. Aim: This study aimed at determining the clinical and laboratory predictors of frequency of painful VOC among SCA patients in Enugu, Southeastern Nigeria. Materials and Methods: It was a cross-sectional study of 100 consecutive SCA patients receiving care at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, Nigeria between May 2012 and February 2014. The eligible patients were categorized into two groups namely; Group A and Group B. Group A/study group (severe disease) comprised SCA patients who had experienced three or more painful crises (≥3 crises) in the last one year preceding the study but, currently in steady state, while Group B/control group (mild–moderate disease), comprised SCA patients matched for age, sex, highest educational status, and occupation but who have had no painful crisis or had only one or two painful crises (0–2 crises) in the last one year preceding the study and currently in steady state. Results: The overall mean age of the patients was 18.4±12.2 (range=2-52) years. The mean values of the haematological parameters including haemoglobin concentration, white cell count, platelet count, and neutrophil count were significantly higher in those with severe crises than mild-moderate crises (p<0.05). Sickle cell related complications including Avascular Necrosis (AVN) and leg ulcers were significantly higher in the study group than the control group (p<0.05). Conclusion: There was significant association between the frequency of crises and haemogblobin level, platelet and neutrophil counts and some clinical parameters: AVN, nephropathy and stroke. Future preventive interventions for reduction in frequency of crisis amongst patients with SCA could be targeted at controlling the blood levels of the identified haematological parameters. © 2017, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

247,Evaluation of Macular Vascular Abnormalities Identified by Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography in Sickle Cell Disease,2017,American Journal of Ophthalmology,"Purpose To evaluate macular vascular flow abnormalities identified by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) in patients with various sickle cell genotypes. Design Prospective, observational case series. Methods This is a single-institution case series of adult patients with various sickle cell genotypes. All patients underwent macular OCT-A (Avanti RTVue XR). Images were analyzed qualitatively for areas of flow loss and quantitatively for measures of foveal avascular area, parafoveal flow, and vascular density. The findings were compared by sickle cell genotype and retinopathy stage and correlated to retinal thickness and visual acuity. Results OCT-A scans of 82 eyes from 46 patients (60.9% female, mean age 33.5 years) were included. Sickle cell genotypes included 27 patients with hemoglobin SS (58.7%), 14 SC (30.4%), 4 beta-thalassemia (8.7%), and 1 sickle trait (2.2%). Discrete areas of flow loss were noted in 37.8% (31/82) of eyes overall and were common in both SS (40.0%, 20/50 eyes) and SC (41.7%, 10/24 eyes). Flow loss was more extensive in the temporal and nasal parafoveal subfields of the deep plexus with sickle SC or proliferative retinopathy. Retinal thickness measurements correlated with vascular density of the fovea, parafovea, and temporal and superior subfields. Visual acuity correlated with foveal avascular zone area and parafoveal vascular density in the superficial and deep plexi. Conclusions Areas of abnormal macular vascular flow are common in patients with various sickle cell genotypes. These areas may be seen at any retinopathy stage but may be more extensive with sickle SC or proliferative retinopathy. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","['adult', '  angiography device', '  Article', '  capillary', '  capillary density', '  case study', '  clinical article', '  disease severity', '  female', '  genotype', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  human', '  image quality', '  male', '  observational study', '  optical coherence tomography', '  optical coherence tomography angiography', '  optical coherence tomography device', '  priority journal', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  prospective study', '  retina angiography', '  retina blood flow', '  retina maculopathy', '  retina neovascularization', '  retinal thickness', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell beta thalassemia', '  sickle cell trait', '  spectral domain optical coherence tomography', '  visual acuity', '  abnormalities', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  complication', '  eye fundus', '  fluorescence angiography', '  follow up', '  optical coherence tomography', '  pathophysiology', '  procedures', '  retina blood vessel', '  retina macula lutea', '  Retinal Diseases', '  vascularization', '  visual acuity', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Female', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Follow-Up Studies', '  Fundus Oculi', '  Humans', '  Macula Lutea', '  Male', '  Prospective Studies', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retinal Vessels', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence', '  Visual Acuity']",43.0,Elsevier Inc.,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1

249,Quantitative characteristics of sickle cell retinopathy in optical coherence tomography angiography,2017,Biomedical Optics Express,"Early detection is an essential step for effective intervention of sickle cell retinopathy (SCR). Emerging optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) provides excellent three-dimensional (3D) resolution to enable label-free, noninvasive visualization of retinal vascular structures, promising improved sensitivity in detecting SCR. However, quantitative analysis of SCR characteristics in OCTA images is yet to be established. In this study, we conducted comprehensive analysis of six OCTA parameters, including blood vessel tortuosity, vessel diameter, vessel perimeter index (VPI), area of foveal avascular zone (FAZ), contour irregularity of FAZ and parafoveal avascular density. Compared to traditional retinal thickness analysis, five of these six OCTA parameters show improved sensitivity for SCR detection than retinal thickness. It is observed that the most sensitive parameters were the contour irregularity of FAZ in the superficial layer and avascular density in temporal regions, while the area of FAZ, tortuosity and mean diameter of the vessel were moderately sensitive. © 2017 Optical Society of America.","['Angiography', '  Blood vessels', '  Diagnosis', '  Eye protection', '  Medical imaging', '  Noninvasive medical procedures', '  Optical tomography', '  Physiology', '  Three dimensional computer graphics', '  Tomography', '  Comprehensive analysis', '  Contour irregularities', '  Medical and biological imaging', '  Non-invasive assessments', '  Noninvasive visualization', '  Optical diagnostics for medicine', '  Quantitative characteristics', '  Vision systems', '  Ophthalmology', '  adult', '  Article', '  blood vessel diameter', '  blood vessel parameters', '  blood vessel tortuosity', '  clinical article', '  computer interface', '  controlled study', '  discriminant analysis', '  female', '  human', '  image analysis', '  image quality', '  interferometry', '  male', '  mathematetical parameters', '  ophthalmic perimeter', '  optical coherence tomography', '  optical coherence tomography angiography', '  optical density', '  quantitative analysis', '  retina angiography', '  retina blood vessel', '  retina fovea', '  retinal thickness', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  vessel perimeter index']",53.0,OSA - The Optical Society,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Science Foundation, NSF, National Institutes of Health, NIH, RPB]",[],2014 - 2023,1

251,Knowledge insufficient: the management of haemoglobin SC disease,2017,British Journal of Haematology,"Although haemoglobin SC (HbSC) accounts for 30% of sickle cell disease (SCD) in the United States and United Kingdom, evidence-based guidelines for genotype specific management are lacking. The unique pathology of HbSC disease is complex, characterized by erythrocyte dehydration, intracellular sickling and increased blood viscosity. The evaluation and treatment of patients with HbSC is largely inferred from studies of SCD consisting mostly of haemoglobin SS (HbSS) patients. These studies are underpowered to allow definitive conclusions about HbSC. We review the pathophysiology of HbSC disease, including known and potential differences between HbSS and HbSC, and highlight knowledge gaps in HbSC disease management.

252,Prognostic value of T786C and G894T eNOS polymorphisms in sickle cell disease,2017,Nitric Oxide - Biology and Chemistry,"Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS) is crucial for vascular homeostasis. Polymorphisms T786C and G894T affect eNOS regulation and have been related to various diseases. Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), a clinically diverse chronic hemolytic anemia, implies impaired nitric oxide bioavailability. Our aim was to determine eNOS genotype for T786C and G894T polymorphisms in Greek patients with SCD and to elucidate its consequences and effects if any on clinical phenotype. Seventy nine steady state cases, mostly compound heterozygous for Sickle Cell anemia/beta thalassemia and 48 controls were measured. Peripheral blood DNA was extracted and genotyped with PCR-RFLPs and Sanger sequencing. Total RNA was extracted from 18 patients and 9 controls and eNOS mRNA levels were determined by real-time PCR. Genotypes, allele distribution and eNOS mRNA levels did not differ between patients and controls, or among patients with different beta globin gene mutations. The 786CC genotype was more common in S/S and β0/S patients with retinopathy. Moreover, 894TT S/S and β0/S patients tended to have a higher hematocrit than 894GG and GT ones. However, the T786C eNOS genotype does not seem to affect peripheral blood cell-derived eNOS mRNA levels, at least in steady state conditions.

256,New ways to detect pediatric sickle cell retinopathy: A comprehensive review,2017,Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology,"Sickle retinopathy reflects disease-related vascular injury of the eye, which can potentially result in visual loss from vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment. Here we review sickle retinopathy among children with sickle cell disease, describe the epidemiology, pediatric risk factors, pathophysiology, ocular findings, and treatment. Newer, more sensitive ophthalmological imaging modalities are available for retinal imaging, including ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, and optical coherence tomography angiography. Optical coherence tomography angiography provides a noninvasive view of retinal vascular layers that could previously not be imaged and can be quantified for comparative or prospective analyses. Ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography provides a more comprehensive view of the peripheral retina than traditional imaging techniques. Screening for retinopathy by standard fundoscopic imaging modalities detects a prevalence of approximately 10%. In contrast, these more sensitive methods allow for more sensitive examination that includes the retina perimeter where sickle retinopathy is often first detectable. Use of these new imaging modalities may detect a higher prevalence of early sickle pathology among children than has previously been reported. Earlier detection may help in better understanding the pathogenesis of sickle retinopathy and guide future screening and treatment paradigms. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","['child', '  disease association', '  early diagnosis', '  human', '  imaging', '  intermethod comparison', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  optical coherence tomography angiography', '  pathophysiology', '  patient referral', '  prevalence', '  priority journal', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  retina fluorescein angiography', '  retinopathy', '  Review', '  risk factor', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  spectral domain optical coherence tomography', '  systematic review', '  ultra wide field fluorescein angiography', '  visual system examination', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  complication', '  diagnostic imaging', '  meta analysis', '  procedures', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Diagnostic Imaging', '  Diagnostic Techniques', ' Ophthalmological', '  Humans', '  Referral and Consultation', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Risk Factors']",17.0,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,English,Review,['United States'],"[National Heart, Blood Institute, National Eye Institute, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, UL1TR001873]",['United States'],2014 - 2023,1

Furthermore, this study aimed to compare the clinical and laboratory outcomes of the group of patients treated with hydroxyurea with those patients that were not treated with hydroxyurea. Methods Clinical and laboratorial data were obtained by analyzing medical records of patients with sickle cell anemia. Results Data from the medical records of 50 patients were analyzed. Most of the patients were female (56%), aged between 20 and 29 years old. Infections, transfusions, cholecystectomy, splenectomy and systemic arterial hypertension were the most common clinical adverse events of the patients. The most frequent cause of hospitalization was painful crisis. The majority of patients had reduced values of hemoglobin and hematocrit (8.55 ± 1.33 g/dL and 25.7 ± 4.4%, respectively) and increased fetal hemoglobin levels (12 ± 7%). None of the clinical variables was statistically significant on comparing the two groups of patients. Among hematological variables only hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were statistically different between patients treated with hydroxyurea and untreated patients (p-value = 0.005 and p-value = 0.001, respectively). Conclusion Sickle cell anemia requires treatment and follow-up by a multiprofessional team. A current therapeutic option is hydroxyurea.

260,Oral Monomethyl Fumarate Therapy Ameliorates Retinopathy in a Humanized Mouse Model of Sickle Cell Disease,2016,Antioxidants and Redox Signaling,"Aims: Sickle retinopathy (SR) is a major cause of blindness in sickle cell disease (SCD). The genetic mutation responsible for SCD is known, however; oxidative stress and inflammation also figure prominently in the development and progression of pathology. Development of therapies for SR is hampered by the lack of (a) animal models that accurately recapitulate human SR and (b) strategies for noninvasive yet effective retinal drug delivery. This study addressed both issues by validating the Townes humanized SCD mouse as a model of SR and demonstrating the efficacy of oral administration of the antioxidant fumaric acid ester monomethyl fumarate (MMF) in the disease. Results: In vivo ophthalmic imaging, electroretinography, and postmortem histological RNA and protein analyses were used to monitor retinal health and function in normal (HbAA) and sickle (HbSS) hemoglobin-producing mice over a one-year period and in additional HbAA and HbSS mice treated with MMF (15 mg/ml) for 5 months. Functional and morphological abnormalities and molecular hallmarks of oxidative stress/inflammation were evident early in HbSS retinas and increased in number and severity with age. Treatment with MMF, a known inducer of Nrf2, induced γ-globin expression and fetal hemoglobin production, improved hematological profiles, and ameliorated SR-related pathology. Innovation and Conclusion: United States Food and Drug Administration-approved formulations in which MMF is the primary bioactive ingredient are currently available to treat multiple sclerosis; such drugs may be effective for treatment of ocular and systemic complications of SCD, and given the pleiotropic effects, other nonsickle-related diseases in which oxidative stress, inflammation, and retinal vascular pathology figure prominently.

261,Expression pattern of HIF-1α and VEGF supports circumferential application of scatter laser for proliferative sickle retinopathy,2016,Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science,"PURPOSE. Retinal vascular occlusions in sickle cell anemia patients cause tissue ischemia and the release of angiogenic mediators that promote the development of retinal neovascularization, initiating proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR). Laser photocoagulation (LPC) has emerged as the most common treatment for PSR. Nonetheless, only two randomized controlled clinical trials have evaluated the use of LPC for PSR, and both failed to definitively demonstrate efficacy of this approach. This may be due to a lack of knowledge regarding the appropriate location for placement of laser coagulations in PSR eyes. To help address this question, we examined the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in PSR eyes. METHODS. The expression pattern of HIF-1α and VEGF in PSR (n = 5) and control (n = 3) eyes was examined by immunohistochemistry in different retinal regions defined by the presence or absence of retinal vessels. RESULTS. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and VEGF were expressed in the inner retina of 5/5 untreated PSR eyes adjacent to retinal neovascularization; expression of HIF-1α was not detected (and VEGF only lightly detected) in normal retinal and choroidal vasculature of 3/3 control eyes. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1a and VEGF were strongly expressed in retinal cells within avascular (nonperfused) retina, anterior to the boundary between perfused and nonperfused retina, as well as in posterior ischemic retina in the presence or absence of neovascular sea fans. CONCLUSIONS. If the goal of LPC in PSR is to quench the expression of HIF-1-driven angiogenic mediators, our results support broad application of peripheral laser for its treatment. © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

263,Uncommon retinal vascular diseases,2016,Expert Review of Ophthalmology,"Introduction: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), hypertensive retinopathy (HR) and retinal vein occlusion (RVO) are among the most common retinal vascular diseases, causing severe vision loss in affected patients worldwide. However the spectrum of retinal vascular diseases comprises a wider, more heterogeneous group of clinical entities, that, though less frequent, can prove to be a diagnostic and therapeutical challenge in a clinical setting. Areas covered: In this review we describe the findings of some uncommon retinal vascular disease using a multimodal approach. In the last 50 years, fluorescein angiography (FA) has been the gold standard for retinal vascular diseases. However, in case of choroidal involvement or masking effect generated by haemorrhage, indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) proved to be very useful. Differently from previous examinations, the newly introduced OCT-Angiography (OCT-A) is less invasive (dyeless) depth-resolved tool and thus may particularly useful for the diagnosis and the follow up of these rare vascular diseases. Furthermore, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) offers important structural information and is currently essential for the assessment and monitoring macular details. Expert commentary: FA, ICGA and SD-OCT should be performed in each case of unclear diagnosis in medical retina, in order to establish adequate diagnosis and therapeutic strategies. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","['bevacizumab', '  ranibizumab', '  triamcinolone', '  vasculotropin antibody', '  aneurysm', '  angiography', '  arteriovenous malformation', '  capillary hemangioma', '  choroid', '  clinical feature', '  cryotherapy', '  diagnostic imaging', '  differential diagnosis', '  external beam radiotherapy', '  exudative retinitis', '  fluorescence angiography', '  follow up', '  gold standard', '  human', '  idiopathic macular telangiectasia', '  indocyanine green angiography', '  laser coagulation', '  optical coherence tomography', '  photodynamic therapy', '  retina disease', '  retinal arteriovenous malformation', '  retinal macroaneurysm', '  retinal vascular disease', '  retinopathy', '  retrolental fibroplasia', '  Review', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  spectral domain optical coherence tomography', '  telangiectasia', '  vitrectomy']",0.0,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,English,Review,"['France', ' Italy']",[],['France'],2014 - 2023,2
264,Impact of a Clinical Pharmacy Service on the Management of Patients in a Sickle Cell Disease Outpatient Center,2016,Pharmacotherapy,"Ambulatory care clinical pharmacy services have expanded beyond primary care settings, but literature supporting the benefits of clinical pharmacy involvement with patients who have rare diseases such as sickle cell disease (SCD) is lacking. Hydroxyurea is the only agent approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of SCD; full benefit in controlling pain episodes and other complications is achieved through monitored escalation to a maximum tolerated dose. The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate the impact of a newly implemented clinical pharmacy service on the management of patients with SCD. We performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 385 adults with SCD who received care between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2014, at a single Sickle Cell Outpatient Center that implemented a clinical pharmacy service in August 2013. Data were collected on hydroxyurea dose escalation, immunization completion rates, and health maintenance metrics (screening for nephropathy with microalbuminuria testing, retinopathy with annual retinal examinations, and pulmonary hypertension with echocardiography). The impact of the clinical pharmacy service on quality measurements was evaluated by using univariate and multivariate analyses. The number of pharmacist encounters, defined as a clinic visit when a clinical pharmacist interacted with a patient as documented in the medical records, was associated with an improved hydroxyurea dose escalation rate (odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–2.05, p=0.02). Immunization rates for the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and influenza vaccine were 66%, 47%, and 62%, respectively. The number of pharmacist encounters was associated with improved immunization completion rates (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.17–1.62, p<0.001). Improved screening for microalbuminuria (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.60–2.86, p<0.001) and sickle cell retinopathy (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00–1.35, p=0.05) were also associated with the number of pharmacist encounters. A new clinical pharmacy service implemented in managing a rare disease, SCD, was associated with an improved hydroxyurea dose escalation rate, immunization completion rates, and health maintenance metrics. © 2016 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.","['hydroxyurea', '  influenza vaccine', '  Pneumococcus vaccine', '  13-valent pneumococcal vaccine', '  23-valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine', '  antisickling agent', '  hydroxyurea', '  influenza vaccine', '  adult', '  Article', '  controlled study', '  cross-sectional study', '  echocardiography', '  electronic medical record', '  female', '  hospital pharmacy', '  human', '  immunization', '  kidney disease', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  mass screening', '  microalbuminuria', '  patient care', '  pharmacist', '  pulmonary hypertension', '  retinopathy', '  retrospective study', '  sickle cell anemia', '  United States', '  albuminuria', '  ambulatory care', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  hospital pharmacy', '  maximum tolerated dose', '  middle aged', '  multivariate analysis', '  organization and management', '  outpatient', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Adult', '  Albuminuria', '  Ambulatory Care', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Antisickling Agents', '  Cross-Sectional Studies', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Hydroxyurea', '  Influenza Vaccines', '  Male', '  Maximum Tolerated Dose', '  Middle Aged', '  Multivariate Analysis', '  Outpatients', '  Pharmacists', '  Pharmacy Service', ' Hospital', '  Pneumococcal Vaccines', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retrospective Studies']",8.0,Pharmacotherapy Publications Inc.,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Heart, Blood Institute]",['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
265,Ophthalmic manifestations of sickle cell disease,2016,Southern Medical Journal,"Sickle cell disease (SCD), the most common inherited blood disorder, is characterized by defective oxygen transport. Every part of the eye can be affected by microvascular occlusions from SCD; however, the major cause of vision loss is proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (PSR). Although individuals with the HbSS genotype of SCD manifest more systemic morbidity and those with the HbSC genotype have a milder clinical course, those with HbSC have an increased risk of developing PSR and resultant vision loss. Sickle cell retinopathy has a variable phenotype, even among individuals with the same genotype. Most patients with SCD maintain good vision because the associated retinopathy occurs in the retinal periphery, and any associated ""sea fan"" neovascularization has a high tendency to autoinfarct and regress. Vision loss from PSR is largely preventable via regular retinal examinations and treatment as indicated. Novel retinal imaging techniques such as wide-field fluorescein angiography, spectral domain optical coherence tomography, and optical coherence tomography angiography can identify evidence of retinal microvascular occlusions in most patients with SCD. Further study is necessary to discover which individuals are at highest risk for vision loss, which of these retinal imaging modalities is clinically important, and which systemic treatments may decrease risk of vision loss from sickle cell retinopathy. © 2016 by The Southern Medical Association.","['vasculotropin inhibitor', '  anterior eye segment', '  autosomal recessive inheritance', '  clinical feature', '  eye disease', '  fluorescence angiography', '  human', '  laser coagulation', '  medical assessment', '  morbidity', '  neovascularization (pathology)', '  pathophysiology', '  posterior eye segment', '  prevalence', '  proliferative sickle cell retinopathy', '  retina maculopathy', '  retinopathy', '  Review', '  risk factor', '  screening', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell maculopathy', '  spectral domain optical coherence tomography', '  visual impairment', '  vitrectomy', '  complication', '  eye', '  Eye Diseases', '  pathology', '  Retinal Diseases', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Eye', '  Eye Diseases', '  Humans', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Risk Factors']",23.0,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,English,Review,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
266,Management of sickle cell disease in children,2016,Southern Medical Journal,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a heterogeneous inherited disorder of hemoglobin that causes chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusion, and endothelial dysfunction. These physiologic derangements often lead to multiorgan damage in infancy and throughout childhood. The most common types of SCD are homozygous hemoglobin S (HbSS disease), hemoglobin SC disease, and sickle β thalassemia. HbSS disease and sickle β 0 thalassemia often are referred to as sickle cell anemia because they have similar severity. Screening and preventive measures, including infection prophylaxis and vaccination, have significantly improved outcomes for children with SCD. Evidence-based therapies, such as hydroxyurea and transfusion, play an important role in preventing progression of select complications. Many chronic complications develop insidiously and require multidisciplinary care for effective treatment. Primary care physicians, as well as physicians in many other disciplines, may care for these patients and should be familiar with the potential acute and chronic complications of this disease.

268,Risk factors for visual impairment in patients with sickle cell disease in London,2016,European Journal of Ophthalmology,"Purpose: Dramatically improved health care in recent years has increased the life expectancy of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) as well as the prognosis for its ocular complications.We sought to identify risk factors for visual impairment in patients with SCD in London 4 decades after Goldberg’s seminal studies.Methods: Patients 16 years and older with SCD (genotypes HbSS, HbSC, HbSβ-thalassemia) attending hematology and ophthalmology services were offered ocular examination.Retinopathy was graded according to the Goldberg classification.Visual impairment was defined as corrected distance visual acuity of 20/40 or poorer.Results: In total, 182 eyes of 182 patients (mean ± SD age, 37.2 ± 12.8 years; female, 65.9%) were included.Women were significantly older than men (mean ± SD age, 38.8 ± 13.1 vs 34.2 ± 11.8 years; p = 0.0174).There was no difference in mean age of each genotype group (p>0.15).Risk factors for sight-threatening proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR) were age over 35 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-3.89; p = 0.0359) and HbSC genotype (OR 4.06; 95% CI 2.07-7.98; p<0.0001).Although visual impairment was related to the presence of sight-threatening PSR (OR 7.23; 95% CI 1.50-35.0; p = 0.0138), it was not related to hemoglobin genotype (p>0.50).Conclusions: We present the largest study of ocular findings in SCD in the United Kingdom.Sight-threatening PSR is a risk factor for visual impairment, but hemoglobin genotype status is not. © 2016 Wichtig Publishing.","['adult', '  aged', '  Article', '  cross-sectional study', '  female', '  genotype', '  human', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  middle aged', '  priority journal', '  prospective study', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  United Kingdom', '  visual acuity', '  visual impairment', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  England', '  odds ratio', '  physiology', '  Retinal Diseases', '  risk factor', '  statistics and numerical data', '  Vision Disorders', '  visually impaired person', '  young adult', '  Adult', '  Aged', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Cross-Sectional Studies', '  Female', '  Humans', '  London', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Odds Ratio', '  Prospective Studies', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Risk Factors', '  Vision Disorders', '  Visual Acuity', '  Visually Impaired Persons', '  Young Adult']",14.0,Wichtig Publishing Srl,English,Article,['United Kingdom'],[],['United Kingdom'],2014 - 2023,1
269,Sickle Cell Trait: A Benign State?,2016,Acta Haematologica,"Background: Sickle cell trait (SCT) is the heterozygous form of sickle cell disease and expectedly should be a benign state with no complications ascribed to it. There are numerous reports challenging its being a benign condition, though this is controversial. Methods and Results: A review of the results of the accompanying investigations done on some of the patients show that beta thalassemia may be responsible for many of the ascribed symptoms and complications. These patients may therefore have sickle cell beta thalassemia, a compound heterozygous form of sickle cell disease. Conclusion: It is important to screen for beta thalassemia using red cell indices and quantitation of the different hemoglobin fractions before attributing any symptoms to SCT. DNA analysis, though useful in ascertaining the presence of the sickle cell gene, is not sufficient. There is the need to exclude the presence of mutations for beta thalassemia, which often is geographical region-specific. © 2016 S.

270,Optimizing Adherence Through Provider and Patient Messaging,2016,Population Health Management,"Health care organizations continue to look for cost-effective ways to modify patient behaviors toward a healthier lifestyle, including improving compliance with evidence-based treatment guidelines. This study evaluated the impact on compliance to evidence-based guidelines associated with a member messaging program (MMP) that is delivered via hard copy through the mail and also electronically via web portals. Anonymized member data were reviewed using disease-specific algorithms designed to find gaps in evidence-based care. Gap closure was monitored over a 6-month period after identification and was the main outcome under study. MMP members received at least 1 message describing a specific gap in care identified via claims data. In addition, if a match was possible, the same message also was sent to the member's physician. MMP members were then compared to a cohort not receiving messages but having the same gaps in care. Multiple regression analysis was performed using a generalized linear model with gap closure as the outcome to infer the relationship between receiving a notification and closing a gap in care. Of the 140 gaps addressed in the study, 23 showed a statistically significant (P < 0.05) difference in gap closure rates between the messaged group and the non-messaged group. Diabetes-related gap closures accounted for 10 of the 23 significant outcomes.

272,Association between sickle cell trait and the prevalence and severity of diabetic retinopathy,2016,PLoS ONE,"Purpose To determine whether Sickle cell trait (SCT) is associated with an increased severity of diabetic retinopathy. Methods This was a single center retrospective study case control study of 100 eyes of 100 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) with SCT (SCT group) and 100 eyes of 100 age-matched patients with DM without SCT (control group). The main outcome measure was the difference in the prevalence of sight threatening DR [here defined as diabetic macular edema (DME) and/or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR)], between the SCT and control groups. Secondary outcome measures included differences in visual acuity, ocular comorbidities, intraocular pressure, glycemic control as assessed by random blood glucose measurement, diabetes duration, nephropathy, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Results The SCT group had statistically significantly shorter duration of DM (median [25% quartile] 15 [8.3] years versus 20 [14.7] years, respectively)(P<0.001) and presented with statistically better metabolic control (mean difference 1.6 mmol/l, (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.1-3.3;P = 0.03). The prevalence of PDR and/or DME was significantly lower in the SCT group (58%) compared to the control group, (95%)(P<0.001). The absence of SCT (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 24; 95% CI, 8-72; P<0.001) and longer duration of DM (AOR = 1.1 [95% CI, 1.02-1.13]; P = 0.003) were independent predictors of PDR and/or DME. Conclusions SCT seems to protect against the development and progression of DR. This may have implications for monitoring and screening. Prospective studies are required to confirm this association.If true, this association may indicate an increased blood glucose buffering capacity of abnormal hemoglobin. © 2016 Al Harbi et al.

273,Imaging foveal microvasculature: Optical coherence tomography angiography versus adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope fluorescein angiography,2016,Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science,"PURPOSE. To compare the use of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope fluorescein angiography (AOSLO FA) for characterizing the foveal microvasculature in healthy and vasculopathic eyes. METHODS. Four healthy controls and 11 vasculopathic patients (4 diabetic retinopathy, 4 retinal vein occlusion, and 3 sickle cell retinopathy) were imaged with OCTA and AOSLO FA. Foveal perfusion maps were semiautomatically skeletonized for quantitative analysis, which included foveal avascular zone (FAZ) metrics (area, perimeter, acircularity index) and vessel density in three concentric annular regions of interest. On each set of OCTA and AOSLO FA images, matching vessel segments were used for lumen diameter measurement. Qualitative image comparisons were performed by visual identification of microaneurysms, vessel loops, leakage, and vessel segments. RESULTS. Adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope FA and OCTA showed no statistically significant differences in FAZ perimeter, acircularity index, and vessel densities. Foveal avascular zone area, however, showed a small but statistically significant difference of 1.8% (P = 0.004). Lumen diameter was significantly larger on OCTA (mean difference 5.7 μm, P < 0.001). Microaneurysms, fine structure of vessel loops, leakage, and some vessel segments were visible on AOSLO FA but not OCTA, while blood vessels obscured by leakage were visible only on OCTA. CONCLUSIONS. Optical coherence tomography angiography is comparable to AOSLO FA at imaging the foveal microvasculature except for differences in FAZ area, lumen diameter, and some qualitative features. These results, together with its ease of use, short acquisition time, and avoidance of potentially phototoxic blue light, support OCTA as a tool for monitoring ocular pathology and detecting early disease. © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

274,LDH and age are associated with hemolysis-endothelial dysfunction in HbSC patients,2016,"Blood Cells, Molecules, and Diseases","Purpose: Despite not yet explored, the serumlactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level in hemoglobinopathy SC (HbSC) patients could be a marker of disease severity as this association is strong in sickle cell patients. Wehypothesized that the degree of hemolysis in HbSC patients is a key determinant influencing a spectrum of complications that reflect the severity of HbSC vasculopathy. The aim of this study was to analyze the associations between hemolytic parameters and chronic complications in adult SC patients. Findings: We demonstrated that LDH reflects the overall rate of hemolysis and presents a correlation with the complications related to the hemolytic subphenotype: retinopathy, venous thromboembolism and leg ulcers in HbSC patients. Remarkably, this simple biomarker was associated with a clinical subphenotype of complications in patients with HbSC disease. Conclusions: Wepropose that LDH elevation identifies HbSC patients with hemolysis, which could be a marker of endothelial dysfunction and end-organ vasculopathy.

275,Sickle Cell Crisis Complicated by Synthetic Cannabinoid Abuse: A Case Report,2016,Hemoglobin,"We describe a case of delirium occurring in a hospitalized sickle cell patient. Following admission for a typical pain crisis, the patient continued to report unrelieved pain with marked agitation for several days, despite escalating doses of opioid analgesia, and ultimately required intubation following development of acute chest syndrome (ACS). After some delay, it was discovered that he had been using a synthetic cannabinoid (K2) which may have precipitated his pain crisis and, with hindsight, explained his prolonged period of delirium. Delayed recognition was due to multiple factors, notably the absence of an index of suspicion for this novel drug, the presence of alternate explanations for the patients altered mental status, and the fact that reliable laboratory screening for synthetic cannabinoids is currently not widely available. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","['azithromycin', '  cannabinoid', '  ceftriaxone', '  creatine kinase', '  haloperidol', '  hemoglobin', '  hydromorphone', '  ketorolac', '  lactate dehydrogenase', '  lorazepam', '  morphine', '  troponin T', '  cannabinoid', '  cannabinoid K2', '  narcotic analgesic agent', '  acute chest syndrome', '  adult', '  agitation', '  analgesia', '  antibiotic therapy', '  arm movement', '  Article', '  avascular necrosis', '  backache', '  case report', '  cerebrovascular accident', '  clinical examination', '  computer assisted tomography', '  creatine kinase blood level', '  day hospital', '  delirium', '  drug abuse', '  echocardiography', '  erythrocyte transfusion', '  exchange blood transfusion', '  face mask', '  frontal cerebrovascular accident', '  heart ejection fraction', '  hemoglobin blood level', '  hospital admission', '  hospital patient', '  hospitalization', '  human', '  hypertension', '  hypokinesia', '  hypoxia', '  intensive care unit', '  iron overload', '  knee pain', '  laboratory test', '  lactate dehydrogenase blood level', '  leukocyte count', '  leukocytosis', '  liver injury', '  male', '  medical history', '  mental health', '  oxygen saturation', '  patient controlled analgesia', '  precipitation', '  retinopathy', '  shoulder pain', '  sickle cell crisis', '  slurred speech', '  sputum culture', '  Streptococcus pneumonia', '  systolic heart failure', '  tachycardia', '  thorax pain', '  thorax radiography', '  urinalysis', '  vomiting', '  acute chest syndrome', '  chemically induced', '  complication', '  diagnostic error', '  pain', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Acute Chest Syndrome', '  Analgesics', ' Opioid', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Cannabinoids', '  Delirium', '  Diagnostic Errors', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Pain']",2.0,Taylor and Francis Ltd,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
276,Risk factors for venous thromboembolism in adults with hemoglobin SC or Sβ+ thalassemia genotypes,2016,Thrombosis Research,"Introduction Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common in sickle cell disease (SCD); however, the risk factors associated with VTE in patients with sickle variant syndromes are not known. The primary aim of this study was to determine hematologic and clinical risk factors for VTE in adults with hemoglobin SC or Sβ+ thalassemia genotypes. Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of patients with hemoglobin SC and Sβ+ thalassemia genotypes followed at the Sickle Cell Center for Adults from 2008 to 2012. Data on baseline hematologic parameters and SCD-specific comorbidities were collected from review of electronic records. Results A total of 116 patients, 85 (73%) with hemoglobin SC disease and 31 (27%) with Sβ+-thalassemia, were included for analysis. Thirty-two (28%) patients had a verified history of non-catheter related VTE. Mean baseline hemoglobin levels were higher among individuals with a history of VTE compared to those without (11.7 g/dL vs. 11.0 g/dL, p = 0.003). In addition, the prevalence of surgical splenectomy was higher among patients with VTE compared to those without (25.0% vs. 4.8%, p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, elevated baseline hemoglobin (odds ratio [OR] 2.45 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-4.23)) and history of surgical splenectomy (OR 5.76 [CI 1.43-23.22]) were independently associated with VTE risk. Conclusions Higher baseline hemoglobin is a risk factor for non-catheter-related VTE in patients with hemoglobin SC or Sβ+ thalassemia genotypes. Surgical splenectomy, which is a known risk factor for VTE in other hemoglobinopathies such as β-thalassemia intermedia, is also associated with VTE in sickle variant syndromes. Future studies are needed to validate these findings and to investigate the mechanisms of hypercoagulability observed in patients with hemoglobin SC and Sβ+ thalassemia. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","['hemoglobin', '  hemoglobin', '  adult', '  aged', '  Article', '  avascular necrosis', '  cerebrovascular accident', '  comorbidity', '  cross-sectional study', '  female', '  genotype', '  hematological parameters', '  hemoglobin blood level', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  human', '  leg ulcer', '  leukocyte count', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  medical history', '  medical record review', '  priority journal', '  reticulocyte count', '  retinopathy', '  risk factor', '  sickle cell beta thalassemia', '  splenectomy', '  thrombocyte count', '  venous thromboembolism', '  beta thalassemia', '  blood', '  complication', '  genetics', '  middle aged', '  retrospective study', '  risk factor', '  sickle cell anemia', '  venous thromboembolism', '  young adult', '  Adult', '  Aged', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  beta-Thalassemia', '  Cross-Sectional Studies', '  Female', '  Genotype', '  Hemoglobins', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Retrospective Studies', '  Risk Factors', '  Venous Thromboembolism', '  Young Adult']",18.0,Elsevier Ltd,English,Article,"['India', ' United States']","[National Institutes of Health, NIH, National Heart, Blood Institute]",['United States'],2014 - 2023,2
277,Original Research: Use of hydroxyurea and phlebotomy in pediatric patients with hemoglobin SC disease,2016,Experimental Biology and Medicine,"Hydroxyurea is an excellent therapeutic agent for the pharmacological induction of HbF in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). However, all completed clinical trials of hydroxyurea have excluded patients with hemoglobin SC (HbSC) disease. HbSC differs significantly in pathophysiology from HbSS, as HbC does not sickle, but instead causes cellular dehydration which potentiates sickling of HbS. Many severely affected HbSC patients have been placed on hydroxyurea on a case by case basis, but there are no large scale prospective data on safety or efficacy of hydroxyurea in this subset of patients with SCD. Here, we report a case series of 14 pediatric patients with HbSC treated to maximum tolerated dose (MTD) with hydroxyurea. Those who failed to show clinical improvement after at least six months at MTD were offered phlebotomy in addition to hydroxyurea. Five out of 11 patients with HbSC who achieved MTD failed to demonstrate clinical improvement on hydroxyurea. Of the four placed on dual hydroxyurea and phlebotomy therapy, all showed at least partial clinical improvement. Percent dense red blood cells (%DRBC) were measured via an ADVIA hematology analyzer. A marked rise in percent dense cells preceded clinical complications in three patients. Dual therapy with hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may be an effective approach to patients with HbSC that do not experience improvement with hydroxyurea alone. Monitoring of %DRBC may predict adverse events and aid in assessing hydroxyurea compliance. Large scale clinical trials are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hydroxyurea and hydroxyurea with phlebotomy in patients with HbSC disease. © 2016, 2016 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.","['hydroxyurea', '  antisickling agent', '  hydroxyurea', '  abdominal pain', '  adolescent', '  Article', '  avascular necrosis', '  cell density', '  child', '  clinical article', '  controlled study', '  demography', '  female', '  hemoglobin blood level', '  high performance liquid chromatography', '  human', '  low drug dose', '  male', '  neutropenia', '  neutrophil count', '  pediatrics', '  phlebotomy', '  retinopathy', '  school child', '  sickle cell anemia', '  thrombocytopenia', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  multimodality cancer therapy', '  phlebotomy', '  procedures', '  Antisickling Agents', '  Child', '  Combined Modality Therapy', '  Female', '  Hemoglobin SC Disease', '  Humans', '  Hydroxyurea', '  Male', '  Phlebotomy']",8.0,SAGE Publications Inc.,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
278,The role of blood rheology in sickle cell disease,2016,Blood Reviews,"Studies performed in the last decades have highlighted the need to better understand the contribution of the endothelium, vascular function, oxidative stress, inflammation, coagulation, hemolysis and vascular adhesion mechanisms to the pathophysiology of acute vaso-occlusive like events and chronic organ damages in sickle cell disease (SCD). Although SCD is a hemorheological disease, a few works focused on the contribution of blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, red blood cell deformability and aggregation in the pathophysiology of SCD. After a brief description of basic hemorheology, the present review focuses on the role of the hemorheological abnormalities in the causation of several SCD complications, mainly in sickle cell anemia and hemoglobin (Hb) SC disease.

279,Scientific Rationale for the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria for Intravenous Alteplase in Acute Ischemic Stroke A Statement for Healthcare Professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association,2016,Stroke,"Purpose-To critically review and evaluate the science behind individual eligibility criteria (indication/inclusion and contraindications/exclusion criteria) for intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (alteplase) treatment in acute ischemic stroke. This will allow us to better inform stroke providers of quantitative and qualitative risks associated with alteplase administration under selected commonly and uncommonly encountered clinical circumstances and to identify future research priorities concerning these eligibility criteria, which could potentially expand the safe and judicious use of alteplase and improve outcomes after stroke. Methods-Writing group members were nominated by the committee chair on the basis of their previous work in relevant topic areas and were approved by the American Heart Association Stroke Council's Scientific Statement Oversight Committee and the American Heart Association's Manuscript Oversight Committee. The writers used systematic literature reviews, references to published clinical and epidemiology studies, morbidity and mortality reports, clinical and public health guidelines, authoritative statements, personal files, and expert opinion to summarize existing evidence and to indicate gaps in current knowledge and, when appropriate, formulated recommendations using standard American Heart Association criteria. All members of the writing group had the opportunity to comment on and approved the final version of this document. The document underwent extensive American Heart Association internal peer review, Stroke Council Leadership review, and Scientific Statements Oversight Committee review before consideration and approval by the American Heart Association Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee. Results-After a review of the current literature, it was clearly evident that the levels of evidence supporting individual exclusion criteria for intravenous alteplase vary widely. Several exclusionary criteria have already undergone extensive scientific study such as the clear benefit of alteplase treatment in elderly stroke patients, those with severe stroke, those with diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia, and those with minor early ischemic changes evident on computed tomography. Some exclusions such as recent intracranial surgery are likely based on common sense and sound judgment and are unlikely to ever be subjected to a randomized, clinical trial to evaluate safety. Most other contraindications or warnings range somewhere in between. However, the differential impact of each exclusion criterion varies not only with the evidence base behind it but also with the frequency of the exclusion within the stroke population, the probability of coexistence of multiple exclusion factors in a single patient, and the variation in practice among treating clinicians. © 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.","['alteplase', '  apixaban', '  argatroban', '  dabigatran', '  low molecular weight heparin', '  rivaroxaban', '  warfarin', '  fibrinolytic agent', '  tissue plasminogen activator', '  aorta dissection', '  artery puncture', '  Article', '  bacterial endocarditis', '  bleeding tendency', '  blood clotting disorder', '  brain hemorrhage', '  brain ischemia', '  brain surgery', '  brain tumor', '  catheterization', '  comorbidity', '  computer assisted tomography', '  congenital blood vessel malformation', '  dementia', '  diabetes mellitus', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  disability', '  disease severity', '  drug efficacy', '  drug safety', '  drug use', '  endocarditis', '  fibrinolytic therapy', '  gastrointestinal hemorrhage', '  genital bleeding', '  glucose blood level', '  head injury', '  health care personnel', '  heart injury', '  hematologic disease', '  human', '  hyperglycemia', '  hypertension', '  injury', '  intracardiac thrombosis', '  kidney failure', '  life expectancy', '  liver failure', '  major surgery', '  medical society', '  menorrhagia', '  menstruation', '  morbidity', '  mortality', '  nursing home', '  patient history of surgery', '  pericarditis', '  practice guideline', '  pregnancy', '  priority journal', '  puerperium', '  qualitative analysis', '  quantitative analysis', '  research priority', '  risk assessment', '  seizure', '  sickle cell anemia', '  spine surgery', '  stroke patient', '  thrombocyte', '  thrombocytopenia', '  treatment outcome', '  unruptured intracranial aneurysm', '  urinary tract hemorrhage', '  adult', '  age', '  aged', '  bleeding', '  brain ischemia', '  chemically induced', '  complication', '  evidence based medicine', '  intravenous drug administration', '  middle aged', '  patient selection', '  practice guideline', '  Stroke', '  United States', '  very elderly', '  Administration', ' Intravenous', '  Adult', '  Age Factors', '  Aged', '  Aged', ' 80 and over', '  American Heart Association', '  Brain Ischemia', '  Evidence-Based Medicine', '  Fibrinolytic Agents', '  Hemorrhage', '  Humans', '  Middle Aged', '  Patient Selection', '  Practice Guidelines as Topic', '  Risk Assessment', '  Societies', ' Medical', '  Stroke', '  Tissue Plasminogen Activator', '  United States']",473.0,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,English,Article,[''],"[National Institutes of Health, NIH, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences]",[],2014 - 2023,1
280,Effects of hydroxyurea treatment for patients with hemoglobin SC disease,2016,American Journal of Hematology,"Although hemoglobin SC (HbSC) disease is usually considered less severe than sickle cell anemia (SCA), which includes HbSS and HbS/β0-thalassemia genotypes, many patients with HbSC experience severe disease complications, including vaso-occlusive pain, acute chest syndrome, avascular necrosis, retinopathy, and poor quality of life. Fully 20 years after the clinical and laboratory efficacy of hydroxyurea was proven in adult SCA patients, the safety and utility of hydroxyurea treatment for HbSC patients remain unclear. Recent NHLBI evidence-based guidelines highlight this as a critical knowledge gap, noting HbSC accounts for ∼30% of sickle cell patients within the United States. To date, only 5 publications have reported short-term, incomplete, or conflicting laboratory and clinical outcomes of hydroxyurea treatment in a total of 71 adults and children with HbSC. We now report on a cohort of 133 adult and pediatric HbSC patients who received hydroxyurea, typically for recurrent vaso-occlusive pain. Hydroxyurea treatment was associated with a stable hemoglobin concentration; increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV); and reduced white blood cell count (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and absolute reticulocyte count (ARC). Reversible cytopenias occurred in 22% of patients, primarily neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Painful events were reduced with hydroxyurea, more in patients &gt;15 years old. These multicenter data support the safety and potentially salutary effects of hydroxyurea treatment for HbSC disease; however, a multicenter, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trial is needed to determine if hydroxyurea therapy has efficacy for patients with HbSC disease. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","['antisickling agent', '  hydroxyurea', '  adolescent', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  child', '  clinical trial', '  female', '  genetics', '  human', '  male', '  multicenter study', '  retrospective study', '  treatment outcome', '  Adolescent', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Antisickling Agents', '  Child', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Hydroxyurea', '  Male', '  Retrospective Studies', '  Treatment Outcome']",51.0,Wiley-Liss Inc.,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
281,Peripheral avascular retina with disk anomaly and high myopia: A novel association in a hereditary isolated ocular disorder,2016,Retina,"Purpose: To describe a family pedigree with a previously undescribed association of autosomal dominantly inherited ocular abnormalities. Methods: Case series study performed on 15 family members. Examination included history taking, visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slit-lamp, gonioscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy (10 members), fluorescein angiography (5 members), general examination and renal ultrasound (4 members), and hemoglobin electrophoresis for the proband and another member. Results: Family pedigree revealed autosomal-dominant inheritance. Visual acuity ranged from 6/36 to no light perception. Examination revealed rubeosis in 7 eyes and atrophia bulbi in 11 eyes. Indirect ophthalmoscopy for 11 eyes revealed evidence of an ocular triad of peripheral avascular retina, disk anomaly (cavitary optic disk anomaly or disk dysplasia), and tessellated fundus of high myopia. The authors also observed new vessels elsewhere with or without extensive subretinal exudations in 6 eyes. All patients with any residual vision (up to perception of light) had nystagmus. Four affected members underwent general examination, renal ultrasound, and serum creatinine level (to exclude papillorenal syndrome), and all were normal. Hemoglobin electrophoresis (to exclude sickle cell retinopathy) revealed within normal values.

282,Rheology of red blood cells in patients with HbC disease,2016,Clinical Hemorheology and Microcirculation,"Patients with hemoglobin C disease (CC) usually do not develop severe complications in comparison with individuals with sickle cell anemia (SS) or with sickle cell hemoglobin C disease (SC). The present study compared the hematological, biochemical, hemorheological and clinical characteristics of CC patients to those of SS, SC and healthy individuals (AA). Blood viscosity was measured at 225 s-1 with a cone plate viscometer. The hematocrit-to-blood viscosity ratio (HVR), i.e. an index of red blood cell (RBC) oxygen transport effectiveness, was calculated. RBC deformability was determined at 30 Pa by ektacytometry, and RBC aggregation properties by syllectometry. CC and SC had higher blood viscosity and lower HVR than AA. Nevertheless, HVR was higher in CC compared to SS and tended to be higher than in SC. The CC group exhibited very rigid hyperchromic RBC compared to the three other groups. RBC aggregation abnormalities were observed in CC: low RBC aggregation index and high RBC aggregates strength. Despite these hemorheological abnormalities, CC never had hospitalized painful vaso-occlusive crisis or acute chest syndrome. In contrast, all of them had splenomegaly. Of note, 2 out of 7 CC developed retinopathy or otologic disorders. Whether the blood hyperviscosity and decreased RBC deformability are responsible for these complications is unknown. The higher oxygen transport effectiveness (i.e., HVR) of CC compared to SS is probably at the origin of the very low risk of medical complication in this population. © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.","['aspartate aminotransferase', '  bilirubin', '  lactate dehydrogenase', '  adult', '  Article', '  blood viscosity', '  clinical article', '  erythrocyte', '  erythrocyte aggregation', '  erythrocyte deformability', '  flow kinetics', '  hematocrit to blood viscosity ratio', '  hematological parameters', '  hemoglobin C disease', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  human', '  mean corpuscular hemoglobin', '  mean corpuscular volume', '  oxygen transport', '  reticulocyte', '  sickle cell anemia', '  blood', '  blood rheology', '  erythrocyte', '  erythrocyte count', '  female', '  hemoglobin C disease', '  male', '  metabolism', '  middle aged', '  pathology', '  Adult', '  Blood Viscosity', '  Erythrocyte Count', '  Erythrocyte Deformability', '  Erythrocytes', '  Female', '  Hemoglobin C Disease', '  Hemorheology', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Middle Aged']",10.0,IOS Press,English,Article,"['France', ' Guadeloupe']",[],['Guadeloupe'],2014 - 2023,2
283,Anti-angiogenic properties of vitreous,2016,The Curated Reference Collection in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Psychology,"Vitreous is vascularized in the fetus but is avascular through normal adult life. This gel changing from a pro-angiogenic to anti-angiogenic milieu accompanies the loss in vasculature. The avascularity of adult vitreous may be due to the myriad of anti-angiogenic proteins normally present that include transforming growth factor-β, pigment epithelial-derived factor, thrombospondin, and endostatin. In disease states such as diabetic and sickle cell retinopathies, preretinal neovascularization grows from retina into vitreous. These angiogenic events occur when there is a shift in balance between angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and anti-angiogenic factors and the vitreous returns to a pro-angiogenic environment. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

284,Correlation of multimodal imaging in sickle cell retinopathy,2016,Retina,"Purpose: To correlate macular findings on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) with quantitative ischemic index calculations on ultra-wide-field fluorescein angiography (UWFFA) in patients with sickle cell retinopathy. Methods: In this retrospective case series, SDOCT, OCTA, and UWFFA images of patients with sickle cell retinopathy were evaluated. Eyes were staged based on the Goldberg classification of proliferative sickle cell retinopathy. Focal areas of macular thinning were assessed on SDOCT, macular vessel density was derived from OCTA, and peripheral ischemic index was calculated from UWFFA. Results: Eighteen eyes of 10 patients were included. Mean age was 36.8 ± 16.8 years, and 6 patients (11 eyes) were SS, 3 patients (5 eyes) were SC, and 1 patient (2 eyes) was Sb thalassemia in hemoglobin electrophoresis. Abnormal macular findings included inner retinal atrophy in 11 eyes (61%) on SDOCT, vascular remodeling and nonperfusion in the superficial and deep retinal capillary plexus in 12 eyes (67%) on OCTA, and macular microvascular abnormalities in 9 eyes (50%) on UWFFA. Sickle cell retinopathy Stage I was identified in 4 eyes (22.2%), Stage II in 8 eyes (44.4%), and Stage III in 6 eyes (33.3%). Mean ischemic index was 14.1 ± 9.1%. Ischemic index was significantly correlated with hemoglobinopathy subtype (23.7 ± 9.8%, 9.3 ± 5.4%, and 16.3 ± 3.2%, for SC, SS, and Sb thalassemia disease, respectively), stage of sickle cell retinopathy (22.5 ± 9.2%, 12.5 ± 4.9%, and 4.5 ± 0.73% for Stages III, II, and I, respectively), and presence of retinal thinning on SDOCT (17.4 ± 9.7% vs. 8.8 ± 5.1%, respectively). Conclusion: Multimodal imaging can provide a more complete description of the microvascular and structural alterations associated with sickle retinopathy. The correlation between the severity of peripheral nonperfusion and stage and subtype of retinopathy suggests that UWF imaging may be a useful tool in the evaluation of these patients.","['hemoglobin', '  adolescent', '  adult', '  aged', '  angiography', '  best corrected visual acuity', '  case study', '  clinical article', '  Conference Paper', '  electrophoresis', '  female', '  fluorescence angiography', '  hemoglobinopathy', '  human', '  male', '  multimodal imaging', '  observational study', '  optical coherence tomography', '  optical coherence tomography angiography', '  optical coherence tomography device', '  retinopathy', '  retrospective study', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  spectral domain optical coherence tomography', '  thalassemia', '  ultra wide field fluorescein angiography', '  vascular remodeling', '  clinical trial', '  computed tomographic angiography', '  diagnostic imaging', '  fluorescence angiography', '  microvasculature', '  middle aged', '  multicenter study', '  multimodal imaging', '  procedures', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  young adult', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Aged', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Computed Tomography Angiography', '  Female', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Microvessels', '  Middle Aged', '  Multimodal Imaging', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retrospective Studies', '  Young Adult']",46.0,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,English,Conference Paper,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
285,Treatment of childhood sickle cell disease,2016,Sickle Cell Anemia: From Basic Science to Clinical Practice,"With the advances in our understanding of the complex mechanisms that come into play in sickle cell disease (SCD), medical care improves and patients with SCD live longer. It is, thus, essential to have adequate knowledge of the available and potential treatment modalities for all SCD complications to reduce morbidity and mortality. As in all chronic illnesses, patient education is the most important aspect of treatment. Patients should be enrolled in a routine follow-up program with multidisciplinary care for better outcomes. Penicillin prophylaxis and adequate immunizations must be instated as soon as the diagnosis is made. Regular screening is warranted to predict the risk of central nervous system involvement, pulmonary hypertension, nephropathy and retinopathy. In this chapter, we also discuss the management of acute SCD complications including vaso-occlusive painful crises, fever, cute chest syndrome, acute splenic sequestration, cerebrovascular accidents, priapism, aplastic crisis, hepatobiliary complications and ophthalmologic complications. We also present approaches for chronic complications such as pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic pain, sickle retinopathy, leg ulcers and avascular necrosis.

286,Clinical manifestations and treatment of adult sickle cell disease,2016,Sickle Cell Anemia: From Basic Science to Clinical Practice,"Despite being a disease that stems primarily from abnormalities in the erythrocytes, clinical manifestations and complications of sickle cell disease are known to affect virtually all organs and systems in the human body. Chronic hemolytic anemia and a systemic infl ammatory state are the basic pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie the occurrence of both acute vaso-occlusive events (painfulepisodes, acute chest syndrome, priapism, stroke, etc.) and long-term end-organ damage (heart failure, chronic kidney disease, retinopathy, pulmonary hypertension, leg ulcers, osteoporosis, etc.). Adequate treatment for sickle cell disease in children with vaccination and prophylactic penicillin has allowed most of these patients to reach adulthood. Nevertheless, morbidity in the adult population is high, with many patients presenting with two or more vital organ complications by the age of 40. There is still room for improvement in the prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of complications more frequently encountered by adult hematologists, and need for consultation with other subspecialties becomes a rule when caring for adult sickle cell patients. We review the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of the most relevant aspects of sickle cell disease in adults and summarize current treatment approaches, from supportive care with blood transfusions and hydroxyurea, to curative care with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,4.0,Springer International Publishing,English,Book Chapter,['Brazil'],[],['Brazil'],2014 - 2023,1
287,Optical coherence tomography angiography in retinal diseases,2016,Journal of Ophthalmic and Vision Research,"Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a new, non-invasive imaging system that generates volumetric data of retinal and choroidal layers. It has the ability to show both structural and blood flow information. Split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography (SSADA) algorithm (a vital component of OCTA software) helps to decrease the signal to noise ratio of flow detection thus enhancing visualization of retinal vasculature using motion contrast. Published studies describe potential efficacy for OCTA in the evaluation of common ophthalmologic diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age related macular degeneration (AMD), retinal vascular occlusions and sickle cell disease. OCTA provides a detailed view of the retinal vasculature, which allows accurate delineation of microvascular abnormalities in diabetic eyes and vascular occlusions. It helps quantify vascular compromise depending upon the severity of diabetic retinopathy. OCTA can also elucidate the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in wet AMD. In this paper, we review the knowledge, available in English language publications regarding OCTA, and compare it with the conventional angiographic standard, fluorescein angiography (FA). Finally, we summarize its potential applications to retinal vascular diseases. Its current limitations include a relatively small field of view, inability to show leakage, and tendency for image artifacts. Further larger studies will define OCTA's utility in clinical settings and establish if the technology may offer a non-invasive option of visualizing the retinal vasculature, enabling us to decrease morbidity through early detection and intervention in retinal diseases. © 2016 Journal of Ophthalmic and Vision Research.",,191.0,Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications,English,Review,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
288,"Cross-Sectional analysis of neurocognitive function, retinopathy, and retinal thinning by Spectral-Domain optical coherence tomography in sickle cell patients",2016,Middle East African Journal of Ophthalmology,"Purpose: The purpose was to examine the relationship between neurocognitive function and two distinct forms of retinopathy in sickle cell disease. Materials and Methods: Patients with sickle cell disease (n = 44, age range: 19-56 years, 70% female) were prospectively recruited for this cross-sectional study. Retinopathy was characterized by: (1) Presence of focal retinal thinning on spectral domain optical coherence tomography and (2) determination of the sickle retinopathy stage on funduscopic exam based on Goldberg classification. Neurocognitive function was assessed using the Philadelphia Brief Assessment of Cognition (PBAC), a validated test of cognition. Univariate and multivariate analyses for PBAC score outcomes were performed. Retinal thinning and retinopathy stage were primary variables of interest and age, gender, genotype, education, and history of stroke were covariates. Results: Univariate analysis revealed associations with total PBAC score and age (P = 0.049), history of stroke (P = 0.04), and genotype (P < 0.001). Focal retinal thinning and Goldberg retinopathy stage were not associated with each other in this sample. Neither the presence of focal retinal thinning nor degree of retinopathy was associated with total PBAC score in univariate or multivariate analyses. Conclusions: We find an association between lower cognitive function and older age, history of stroke and sickle cell genotype SS in patients with sickle cell disease. Our data do not provide evidence to support an association between cognitive function and retinopathy in sickle cell patients. © 2016 Middle East African Journal of Ophthalmology.","['adult', '  age', '  Article', '  cerebrovascular accident', '  clinical article', '  cognition', '  controlled study', '  cross-sectional study', '  education', '  female', '  gender', '  genotype', '  human', '  male', '  medical history', '  neurologic examination', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  optical coherence tomography device', '  outcome assessment', '  Philadelphia Brief Assessment of Cognition', '  priority journal', '  retinal thinning', '  retinopathy', '  scoring system', '  sickle cell anemia', '  spectral domain optical coherence tomography', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  classification', '  Cognition Disorders', '  middle aged', '  optical coherence tomography', '  pathophysiology', '  procedures', '  retina', '  Retinal Diseases', '  young adult', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Cognition Disorders', '  Cross-Sectional Studies', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Ophthalmoscopy', '  Retina', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence', '  Young Adult']",6.0,Medknow Publications,English,Article,['United States'],[National Eye Institute],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
289,Critical Reviews: How we treat sickle cell patients with leg ulcers,2016,American Journal of Hematology,"The past five decades have seen an improvement in the mortality and morbidity of sickle cell disease (SCD) because of prophylaxis against infectious complications, improved and expanded red cell transfusions, implementation of hydroxyurea therapy, and advances in supportive care. Now that the majority of patients in the western hemisphere reaches adulthood, end organ diseases are frequent, which include vasculopathic complications such as chronic leg ulcers. The management of patients with leg ulcers requires the hematologist to lead a team of health care professionals, and investigates the presence of associated, but potentially still occult signs of vasculopathy, such as pulmonary hypertension, renal disease, priapism and retinopathy. These complications may be asynchronous, and long term careful screening is indicated, in order to ensure early diagnosis and intervention. It is crucial to address both the immediate consequences of pain, infection and disability, and long term effects on quality of life, employment and stigma associated with chronic ulceration. Recent insights into their pathophysiology may have practical implications. We propose a holistic approach to the management of patients' physical and emotional problems and mechanisms of ulcers formation and delayed healing. An overview of topical and systemic therapies for chronic ulcers is given, with the understanding that wound care therapy is best left to the wound specialists, medical and surgical, with whom the hematologist must keep an open line of communication. In the absence of evidence-based guidelines, our opinion is based on both a critical review of the literature and our personal clinical and research experience. Am. J.

290,Temporal macular atrophy as a predictor of neovascularization in sickle cell retinopathy,2016,Ophthalmic Surgery Lasers and Imaging Retina,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between temporal macular atrophy and the presence of neovascularization in eyes with sickle cell disease (SCD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective, case-controlled study identifying 64 eyes from 38 consecutive patients with SCD. Dilated funduscopic examination and wide-field fluorescein angiography were used to identify the Goldberg stage of proliferative sickle cell retinopathy. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography images were analyzed for the presence of temporal macular atrophy. The association between temporal macular atrophy and neovascularization was then evaluated. RESULTS: Temporal macular atrophy had a sensitivity of 27%, a specificity of 67%, a positive predictive value of 83%, and a negative predictive value of 13% for identifying neovascularization. CONCLUSION: Although the presence of temporal macular atrophy is not sensitive enough to be used as a screening test, if seen in a patient with SCD, the physician should be alerted to the strong possibility that peripheral neovascularization may be present.","['adolescent', '  adult', '  aged', '  clinical article', '  Conference Paper', '  controlled study', '  diagnostic test accuracy study', '  disease association', '  female', '  gold standard', '  human', '  macular degeneration', '  macular thickness', '  male', '  middle aged', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  optical coherence tomography device', '  predictive value', '  priority journal', '  retina fluorescein angiography', '  retina neovascularization', '  retinal thickness', '  retrospective study', '  sensitivity and specificity', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell beta thalassemia', '  spectral domain optical coherence tomography', '  temporal macular atrophy', '  young adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  atrophy', '  case control study', '  laboratory diagnosis', '  optical coherence tomography', '  pathology', '  retina macula lutea', '  Retinal Neovascularization', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Aged', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Atrophy', '  Case-Control Studies', '  False Positive Reactions', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Macula Lutea', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Predictive Value of Tests', '  Retinal Neovascularization', '  Retrospective Studies', '  Sensitivity and Specificity', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence', '  Young Adult']",23.0,Slack Incorporated,English,Conference Paper,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1
291,Renal papillary necrosis: Role of radiology,2016,Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research,"Renal Papillary Necrosis (RPN) is idefined as Ischemic necrobiosis of the papilla in the medulla of the kidneys. Variety of etiological factors are recognized which cause papillary necrosis, such as analgesic nephropathy, diabetes mellitus, urinary obstruction and sickle cell haemoglobinopathy. The early diagnosis of RPN is important to improve prognosis and reduce morbidity. Radiological Imaging offers early diagnosis and can guide prompt treatment of papillary necrosis and can minimize a decline in renal function. Here we report three cases of RPN with typical imaging findings. One of them was diabetic and hypertensive female with recurrent Urinary tract Infections and other was a male with no known co-morbidity. Both of them were diagnosed to have renal papillary necrosis on CT scan and were managed operatively and conservatively, respectively. Third case was a healthy female being investigated to be renal donor for her son. Here RPN was an incidental finding and was treated conservatively. Thus CT scan could detect it pre-operatively and complications due to transplantation of a kidney with papillary necrosis were avoided. So, we want to emphasize the importance of Radiology, particularly CT scanning in detection of RPN and to guide early and prompt treatment. © 2015, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

292,Management of sickle cell disease: Recommendations from the 2014 expert panel report,2015,American Family Physician,"Family physicians are the primary and sometimes only health care resource for families affected by sickle cell disease. Recently published guidelines provide important recommendations for health maintenance, acute care, and monitoring of disease-modifying therapy in persons with this condition. This overview highlights some of the most important clinical activities that can and should be carried out in the community care setting. Children with sickle cell anemia should receive prophylactic penicillin from birth through at least five years of age, and all persons with sickle cell disease require vaccination to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease. Annual screening with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography is recommended for all children with sickle cell disease beginning at two years of age and continuing through adolescence to evaluate the risk of stroke and to initiate transfusion therapy in those at high risk. Vasoocclusive crises require immediate and adequate analgesia appropriate to the level of patient-reported pain. Antibiotics, hospitalization, and incentive spirometry are indicated for those with acute chest syndrome. There is strong evidence to support the promotion and use of hydroxyurea therapy in patients nine months and older who have sickle cell anemia because its use can decrease the frequency of vasoocclusive crises and acute chest syndrome with limited adverse effects. © 2015 American Academy of Family Physicians.","['cephalosporin', '  hemoglobin', '  hydromorphone', '  hydroxyurea', '  morphine', '  nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent', '  penicillin derivative', '  acute chest syndrome', '  Article', '  blood transfusion', '  cerebrovascular accident', '  community care', '  consultation', '  Doppler echography', '  general practitioner', '  hepatobiliary disease', '  hospitalization', '  human', '  kidney disease', '  oxygen therapy', '  pain', '  patient care', '  pneumococcal infection', '  practice guideline', '  priapism', '  quality of life', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  spirometry', '  vaccination', '  vascular disease', '  vasoocclusive crisis', '  adolescent', '  adult', '  aged', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  child', '  female', '  general practice', '  infant', '  male', '  medical education', '  middle aged', '  patient education', '  practice guideline', '  preschool child', '  standards', '  United States', '  very elderly', '  young adult', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Aged', '  Aged', ' 80 and over', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Child', '  Child', ' Preschool', '  Education', ' Medical', ' Continuing', '  Family Practice', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Infant', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Practice Guidelines as Topic', '  United States', '  Young Adult']",30.0,American Academy of Family Physicians,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2014 - 2023,1

295,Cohort study of adult patients with haemoglobin SC disease: Clinical characteristics and predictors of mortality,2015,British Journal of Haematology,"Haemoglobin (Hb) SC disease is the second most common subtype of sickle cell disease and is potentially fatal. This study aimed to determine the clinical characteristics, outcome and predictors of mortality in HbSC disease patients, and to compare these findings with patients followed-up in different centres. Clinical, laboratory and outcome data were collected from a cohort of adult patients with HbSC disease followed between 1991 and 2103. Cox regression multivariate analysis was used to determine predictors of mortality. One hundred and fifty-five patients were followed-up over 20 years: 9% died and 70·8% had at least one complication. The most common complications were: painful crises (38·3%), retinopathy (33·8%), cholelithiasis (30·3%), osteonecrosis (24·8%) and sensorineural hearing disorders (9·7%). Frequency of chronic complications was similar in most studies. In multivariate analysis, hearing disorders remained an independent predictor of mortality (Odds Ratio 9·26, 95% confidence interval 1·1-74·8; P = 0·03). It was concluded that patients with HbSC disease receive a late diagnosis and there is remarkable similarity between the studies conducted in different centres around the world. Sensorineural hearing disorders were an independent predictor of mortality, suggesting that it may be useful to implement routine diagnostic screening. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","['acute chest syndrome', '  adult', '  aged', '  Article', '  bone necrosis', '  brain ischemia', '  cause of death', '  child', '  cholelithiasis', '  chronic kidney disease', '  cohort analysis', '  delayed diagnosis', '  disease association', '  female', '  follow up', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  human', '  leg ulcer', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  middle aged', '  mortality', '  osteomyelitis', '  pain', '  perception deafness', '  predictive value', '  priapism', '  priority journal', '  retinopathy', '  risk assessment', '  screening test', '  spleen disease', '  splenic sequestration', '  thrombosis', '  very elderly', '  adolescent', '  blood', '  Brazil', '  cholelithiasis', '  comorbidity', '  complication', '  Hearing Loss', ' Sensorineural', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  Kaplan Meier method', '  mortality', '  Osteonecrosis', '  pain', '  pregnancy', '  Pregnancy Complications', ' Hematologic', '  proportional hazards model', '  Retinal Diseases', '  young adult', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Aged', '  Aged', ' 80 and over', '  Brazil', '  Child', '  Cholelithiasis', '  Comorbidity', '  Delayed Diagnosis', '  Female', '  Follow-Up Studies', '  Hearing Loss', ' Sensorineural', '  Hemoglobin SC Disease', '  Humans', '  Kaplan-Meier Estimate', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Osteonecrosis', '  Pain', '  Pregnancy', '  Pregnancy Complications', ' Hematologic', '  Proportional Hazards Models', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Young Adult']",19.0,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,English,Article,['Brazil'],[],['Brazil'],2014 - 2023,1
296,"The changing epidemiology of pediatric hemoglobinopathy patients in Northern Alberta, Canada",2015,Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology,"Background: Hemoglobinopathies are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Accurate epidemiologic data reflecting the number of hemoglobinopathy patients are lacking in Canada. Immigration patterns are shifting such that regions where these diseases were rare are seeing a rapid population expansion, revealing a gap in the health care system and the need for a public health response. Methods: To understand the epidemiology of pediatric hemoglobinopathy patients given the provincial population growth and immigration patterns, a retrospective chart review was conducted at the Stollery Children's Hospital from January 2004 to July 2014. Results: A total of 88% of patients had sickle cell disease; 55% of patients were Canadian born and 63% of families originated from Africa. There was a 3.5-fold increase in patient numbers with acceleration in patient accrual over the study period and a delay in diagnosis in 70% of patients. There was a significant increase in the number of hospitalizations over the study period. Thirteen percent required at least 1 exchange transfusion, 16% received chronic transfusions, and 30% of patients developed at least 1 severe complication related to their diagnosis. Conclusions: It is imperative to demonstrate the growing hemoglobinopathy population and changing health care requirements to advocate for appropriate resources, educate health care providers, and increase awareness.

297,Laser therapy for retinopathy in sickle cell disease,2015,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,"Background: Sickle cell disease includes a group of inherited haemoglobinopathies affecting multiple organs including the eyes. Some people with the disease develop ocular manifestations due to vaso-occlusion. Vision-threatening complications of sickle cell disease are mainly due to proliferative sickle retinopathy which is characterized by proliferation of new blood vessels. Laser photocoagulation is widely applicable in proliferative retinopathies such as proliferative sickle retinopathy and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. It is important to evaluate the efficacy and safety of laser photocoagulation in the treatment of proliferative sickle retinopathy to prevent sight-threatening complications. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of various techniques of laser photocoagulation therapy in sickle cell disease-related retinopathy. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 21 September 2015. We also searched the following resources (24 March 2015): Latin American and Carribean Health Science Literature Database (LILACS); WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platforms (ICTRP); and ClinicalTrials.gov. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing laser photocoagulation to no treatment in children and adults. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, the risk of bias of the included trials and extracted and analysed data. We contacted the trial authors for additional information. Main results: Two trials (341 eyes of 238 children and adults) were included comparing efficacy and safety of laser photocoagulation to no therapy in people with proliferative sickle retinopathy. There were 121 males and 117 females with an age range from 13 to 67 years. The laser photocoagulation technique used was different in the two trials; one single-centre trial employed sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation using an argon laser; and the second, two-centre trial, employed feeder vessel coagulation using argon laser in one centre and xenon arc in the second centre. The follow-up period ranged from a mean of 21 to 32 months in one trial and 42 to 47 months in the second. Both trials were at risk of selection bias (random sequence generation) because of the randomisation method employed for participants with bilateral disease. One study was considered to be at risk of reporting bias. Using sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation, one trial (174 eyes) reported that complete regression of proliferative sickle retinopathy was seen in 30.2% in the laser group and 22.4% in the control group (no difference between groups). The same trial reported the development of new proliferative sickle retinopathy in 34.3% of laser-treated eyes and in 41.3% of eyes given no treatment; again, there was no difference between treatment groups. The second trial, using feeder vessel coagulation, did not present full data for either treatment group for these outcomes. There was evidence from both trials (341 eyes) that laser photocoagulation using scatter laser or feeder vessel coagulation may prevent the loss of vision in eyes with proliferative sickle retinopathy (at median follow up of 21 to 47 months). Data from both trials indicated that laser treatment prevented the occurrence of vitreous haemorrhage with both argon and xenon laser; with the protective effect being greater with feeder vessel laser treatment compared to scatter photocoagulation. Regarding adverse effects, the incidence of retinal tear was minimal, with only one event reported. Combined data from both trials were available for 341 eyes; there was no difference between the laser and control arms for retinal detachment. In relation to choroidal neovascularization, treatment with xenon arc was found to be associated with a significantly higher risk, but visual loss related to this complication is uncommon with long-term follow up of three years or more. Data regarding quality of life and other adverse effects were not reported in the included trials. Authors' conclusions: Our conclusions are based on the data from two trials conducted over 20 years ago. In the absence of further evidence, laser treatment for sickle cell disease-related retinopathy should be considered as a one of therapeutic options for preventing visual loss and vitreous haemorrhage. However, it does not appear to have a significant different effect on other clinical outcomes such as regression of proliferative sickle retinopathy and development of new ones. No evidence is available assessing efficacy in relation to patient-important outcomes (such as quality of life or the loss of a driving licence). There is limited evidence on safety, overall, scatter argon laser photocoagulation is superior in terms of adverse effects, although feeder vessel coagulation has a better effect in preventing vitreous haemorrhage. Further research is needed to examine the safety of laser treatment compared to other interventions such as intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factors. In addition, patient-important outcomes as well as cost-effectiveness should be addressed. © 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.","['clinical effectiveness', '  evidence based medicine', '  follow up', '  human', '  laser coagulation', '  outcome assessment', '  patient safety', '  priority journal', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  retina detachment', '  retina tear', '  retinopathy', '  Review', '  selection bias', '  sickle cell anemia', '  subretinal neovascularization', '  systematic review', '  vitreous hemorrhage', '  adolescent', '  adult', '  adverse effects', '  aged', '  child', '  Choroidal Neovascularization', '  complication', '  female', '  gas laser', '  laser coagulation', '  male', '  meta analysis', '  middle aged', '  procedures', '  randomized controlled trial (topic)', '  Retinal Neovascularization', '  sickle cell anemia', '  therapeutic use', '  Vision Disorders', '  vitreous hemorrhage', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Aged', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Child', '  Choroidal Neovascularization', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Laser Coagulation', '  Lasers', ' Gas', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', '  Retinal Neovascularization', '  Vision Disorders', '  Vitreous Hemorrhage']",10.0,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,English,Review,['Malaysia'],"[National Institutes of Health, the National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Blood Institute, National Eye Institute, American Society of Hematology, Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Yale School of Medicine, National Institute for Health Research, British Society for Haematology]",['Malaysia'],2014 - 2023,1
298,Optical coherence tomography angiography of sickle cell maculopathy,2015,Retinal Cases and Brief Reports,"Purpose: To report a case of sickle cell retinopathy imaged with optical coherence tomography angiography. Methods: Case report. Results: An asymptomatic 33-year-old man with known sickle cell anemia (SS) presented for routine eye examination. Ultrawide-field fluorescein angiography confirmed areas of temporal nonperfusion without neovascularization and subtle enlargement of the foveal avascular zone in the left eye. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography showed thinning of the inner layers of the temporal macula in both eyes. Optovue splitspectrum amplitude decorrelation angiography optical coherence tomography was performed and showed reduced flow within the superficial and deep macular plexuses of each eye, most severely within the deep retinal capillary plexus. This abnormality was more extensive than could it be appreciated with conventional angiography. Conclusion: This report provides evidence that optical coherence tomography angiography may be more sensitive in detecting macular capillary nonperfusion than fluorescein angiography. It also provides further evidence that the ischemic vasculopathy of sickle cell retinopathy preferentially affects the deep capillary plexus. © 2015 by Ophthalmic Communications Society, Inc.

301,Spectral domain optical coherence tomography in patients with sickle cell disease,2015,British Journal of Ophthalmology,"Aim: To evaluate spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) changes in central retina and choroid in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Methods: Data on visual acuity, severity of sickle cell retinopathy, macular volume scans and choroidal thickness on SD-OCT were analysed from 208 eyes of 107 consecutive patients referred for screening for SCD. The retinal and choroidal thickness of eyes with SCD were also compared with age and ethnicity matched controls. Results: 44% of the eyes of patients with SCD showed discrete areas of retinal thinning in the temporal macular area. Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy was more prevalent in these eyes compared with SCD eyes with normal macular morphology (67% vs 48%; p=0.0017). The temporal total and inner retinal thickness, macular volume and choroidal thickness were significantly lower in patients with SCD compared with age, gender and ethnicity matched controls. Macular splaying (widening of the macular contour) was noted in 30% of eyes in both groups. The choroidal and retinal thickness values showed good intergrader reliability using weighted κ statistics (0.550-0.9).

303,Spectrum of retinal vascular diseases associated with paracentral acute middle maculopathy,2015,American Journal of Ophthalmology,"Purpose To evaluate the spectrum of retinal diseases that can demonstrate paracentral acute middle maculopathy and isolated ischemia of the intermediate and deep capillary plexus. Design Retrospective, multicenter, observational case series. Methods This is a retrospective case series review of 9 patients (10 eyes) from 5 centers with paracentral acute middle maculopathy lesions and previously unreported retinal vascular etiologies. Case presentations and multimodal imaging, including color photographs, near-infrared reflectance, fluorescein angiography, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT), and orbital color Doppler imaging, are described. Baseline and follow-up findings are correlated with clinical presentation, demographics, and systemic associations. Results Five men and 4 women, aged 27-66 years, were included. Isolated band-like hyperreflective lesions in the middle retinal layers, otherwise known as paracentral acute middle maculopathy, were observed in all patients at baseline presentation. Follow-up SD OCT analysis of these paracentral acute middle maculopathy lesions demonstrated subsequent thinning of the inner nuclear layer. Novel retinal vascular associations leading to retinal vasculopathy and paracentral acute middle maculopathy include eye compression injury causing global ocular ischemia, sickle cell crisis, Purtscher's retinopathy, inflammatory occlusive retinal vasculitis, post-H1N1 vaccine, hypertensive retinopathy, migraine disorder, and post-upper respiratory infection. Conclusion Paracentral acute middle maculopathy lesions may develop in a wide spectrum of retinal vascular diseases. They are best identified with SD OCT analysis and may represent ischemia of the intermediate and deep capillary plexus. These lesions typically result in permanent thinning of the inner nuclear layer and are critical to identify in order to determine the cause of unexplained vision loss. © 2015 BY ELSEVIER INC.

305,Conjunctival microvascular haemodynamics in sickle cell retinopathy,2015,Acta Ophthalmologica,"Purpose To determine alterations in bulbar conjunctival microvascular haemodynamics in sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) subjects with focal macular thinning (FMT). Methods Conjunctival microcirculation imaging and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) were performed in 22 subjects (eyes) diagnosed with SCR. Based on evaluation of SD-OCT retinal thickness maps, eyes were assigned to one of the two groups: with or without FMT. Conjunctival venular diameter and axial blood velocity were measured in multiple venules in each eye by customized image analysis algorithms. Measurements were then categorized into two vessel size groups (vessel size 1 and 2) and compared between FMT groups. A Pearson correlation coefficient was computed to assess the relationship between retinal thickness and axial blood velocity. Results Mean age, haematocrit, sickle cell haemoglobin type and median retinopathy score were not significantly different between the two groups (p ≥ 0.1). Retinal thickness in parafoveal and perifoveal temporal subfields was significantly lower in eyes with FMT as compared to eyes without FMT (p ≤ 0.04). There was a significant effect of FMT on axial blood velocity (p = 0.04), while the effect of vessel size was not significant (p = 0.4). In vessel size 1, axial blood velocity was lower in eyes with FMT than in eyes without FMT (p = 0.03), while in vessel size 2, there was no statistically significant difference between FMT groups (p = 0.1). In vessel size 1, there was a significant positive correlation between axial blood velocity and retinal thickness in the perifoveal (r = 0.48, p = 0.02) and parafoveal (r = 0.43, p = 0.04) temporal subfields. Conclusion Conjunctival axial blood velocity in small venules is reduced in SCR subjects with focal macular thinning. © 2014 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

308,Health-related quality of life after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease,2015,Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy that affects over 100,000 people in the United States. Patients with SCD are known to experience suboptimal health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In addition to the physical manifestations of SCD, psychological and social stress, along with academic difficulties, secondary to the chronicity of the disease and its complications often affect patients with SCD. Although medical therapy of SCD has improved, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) remains the only curative therapy. The objective of this study was to measure HRQoL before and after allo-HCT by assessing physical, psychological, and social functioning in patients with SCD who have undergone reduced-toxicity conditioning (busulfan/fludarabine/alemtuzumab) followed by allo-HCT. Patients < 21 years of age undergoing allo-HCT (matched siblings and unrelated donors) for SCD and their primary caregiver were enrolled using either the English or Spanish version of the PedsQoL 4.0. Data were collected at 3 time points: before allo-HCT and on days 180 and 365 after allo-HCT. The change in HRQoL from baseline was assessed with unadjusted and adjusted mixed-effects models in which subjects were treated as random effects, and variance component structure was used. Seventeen patients and 23 primary caregivers were enrolled and reported a mean overall HRQoL of 66.05 (SD, 15.62) and 72.20 (SD, 15.50) at baseline, respectively. In the patient-reported analysis with adjusted mixed-effects models, the estimated improvements in overall HRQoL were 4.45 (SE, 4.98; P= .380) and 16.58 (SE, 5.06; P= .003) at 180 and 365 days, respectively, after allo-HCT. For parent-reported overall HRQoL, the estimated improvements were 1.57 (SE, 4.82; P= .747) and 9.28 (SE, 4.62; P= .053) at 180 and 365 days, respectively, after allo-HCT. Similar results were found across the physical, social, and emotional HRQoL domains with mixed-effects models after adjustment of demographic and medical variables. In addition to the alleviation of clinical manifestations of SCD, these patients demonstrated significant improvement in most aspects of HRQoL by 1 year after allo-HCT. These data represent the trajectory of HRQoL during the initial year of follow-up within this population and should be integrated into the decision-making process when considering allo-HCT in patients with SCD. © 2015 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.","['alemtuzumab', '  busulfan', '  fludarabine', '  melphalan', '  Acinetobacter infection', '  acute chest syndrome', '  adolescent', '  adult', '  allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '  Article', '  beta thalassemia', '  blood group ABO incompatibility', '  bone marrow', '  brain hemorrhage', '  caregiver', '  cerebrovascular accident', '  child', '  clinical article', '  comparative study', '  controlled study', '  dactylitis', '  diarrhea', '  event free survival', '  fatality', '  female', '  follow up', '  general condition improvement', '  Gram negative sepsis', '  herpes zoster', '  human', '  hypomagnesemia', '  Karnofsky Performance Status', '  male', '  medicaid', '  medical history', '  mucosa inflammation', '  overall survival', '  physical activity', '  postoperative complication', '  postoperative period', '  private health insurance', '  proxy', '  psychological wellbeing assessment', '  quality of life', '  retinopathy', '  self report', '  sickle cell anemia', '  social interaction', '  spleen disease', '  splenic sequestration', '  unrelated donors', '  vein occlusion', '  allograft', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  clinical trial', '  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '  preschool child', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Allografts', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Child', '  Child', ' Preschool', '  Female', '  Follow-Up Studies', '  Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Quality of Life']",58.0,Elsevier Inc.,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Cancer Institute, NCI, P30CA008748]",['United States'],2014 - 2023,1

310,Left atrial volume is not an index of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in patients with sickle cell anaemia,2015,Archives of Cardiovascular Diseases,"Background. - Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) is common in sickle cell anaemia (SCA). Left atrial (LA) size is widely used as an index of LVDD; however, LA enlargement in SCA might also be due to chronic volume overload. Aim. - To investigate whether LA size can be used to diagnose LVDD in SCA. Methods. - One hundred and twenty-seven adults with stable SCA underwent echocardiographic assessment. LA volume was measured by the area-length method and indexed to body surface area (LAVi). Left ventricular (LV) filling pressures were assessed using the ratio of early peak diastolic velocities of mitral inflow and septal annular mitral plane (E/e-). Using mitral inflow profile and E/e-, LV diastolic function was classified as normal or abnormal. LAVi 28 mL/m2 was used as the threshold to define LA enlargement. Results. - The mean age was 28.6 8.5 years; there were 83 women. Mean LAVi was 48.3 11.1 mL/m2 and 124 (98%) patients had LA dilatation. In multivariable analysis, age, haemoglobin concentration and LV end-diastolic volume index were independent determinants of LAVi (R2 = 0.51; P 0.0001). E/e- was not linked to LAVi (P = 0.43). Twenty patients had LVDD; when compared with patients without LVDD, they had a similar LAVi (52.2 14.7 and 47.5 10.2 mL/m2, respectively; P = 0.29). Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis showed that LAVi could not be used to diagnose LVDD (area under curve = 0.58; P = 0.36). Conclusion. - LA enlargement is common in SCA but appears not to be linked to LVDD. LAVi in this population is related to age, haemoglobin concentration and LV morphology. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

311,Interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 gene polymorphisms are associated with manifestations of sickle cell anemia,2015,"Blood Cells, Molecules, and Diseases","Sickle cell anemia (SCA), a disorder characterized by both acute and chronic inflammation, exhibits substantial phenotypic variability. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and IL-6 are important in acute and chronic diseases, and their single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been considered as predictors of prognosis in several inflammatory conditions. This study aims at exploring possible association of IL-1β and IL-6 SNPs as potential genetic modifiers and or predictors of SCA clinical and laboratory phenotypes. This cross-sectional study involved 107 SCA patients and 110 age, sex and ethnicity-matched healthy individuals. The SNPs were identified by PCR-RFLP for IL-1β (-. 511C. >. T and +. 3954C. >. T) and IL-6 (-. 597G. >. A and -. 174G. >. C) genes. Associations between these SNPs and the clinical and laboratory profiles of patients with SCA were then determined. Allelic and genotypic frequencies of IL-1β and IL-6 SNPs between patients with SCA and controls were similar and followed HWE. IL-1β +. 3954C. >. T SNP was associated with increased risk of osteonecrosis, elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and lower absolute reticulocyte count, while IL-6 -. 597G. >. A was associated with higher likelihood of retinopathy and leg ulcer.

312,Macular and peripapillary spectral domain optical coherence tomography changes in sickle cell retinopathy,2015,Retina,"PURPOSE:: To assess peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, macular ganglion cell complex, and total macular thicknesses using spectral domain optical coherence tomography on sickle cell disease patients with and without sickle retinopathy. METHOD:: Nineteen eyes of 11 patients with hemoglobin sickle cell disease, 65 eyes of 36 patients with hemoglobin SS disease, and 48 eyes of 24 healthy subjects underwent spectral domain optical coherence tomography scanning (RTVue). Eyes of patients with sickle cell disease were classified into 3 groups according to posterior segment changes: no retinopathy (n = 64), nonproliferative retinopathy (n = 12), and proliferative retinopathy (n = 8). RESULTS:: The central fovea in eyes with proliferative retinopathy was thickened compared with control group, sickle cell disease without retinopathy, and nonproliferative retinopathy (P = 0.004); a difference between proliferative retinopathy and sickle cell disease without retinopathy groups was still present after age adjustment (P = 0.014). Eyes with proliferative changes showed higher ganglion cell complex focal loss of volume compared with control group (P = 0.002), even after age adjustment (P = 0.004). Thinning of the nasal retinal nerve fiber layer quadrant was observed in eyes with proliferative retinopathy (P < 0.001); however, no retinal nerve fiber layer thickness difference was observed after age correction (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION:: Peripheral changes secondary to proliferative sickle retinopathy were associated with thinning of macular inner retinal layers and thickening of central fovea.

313,Sickle cell disease in children: Chronic complications and search of predictive factors for adverse outcomes,2015,European Journal of Haematology,"Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) has extremely variable phenotypes, and several factors have been associated with the severity of the disease. Objectives: To analyze the chronic complications of SCD and look for predictive risk factors for increased severity and number of complications. Methods: Retrospective study including all children followed for SCD in the Paediatric Haematology Unit of a tertiary hospital in Portugal, who completed 17 yr old between the years 2004 and 2013. Results: We identified 44 patients, 55% female and 98% black. Chronic complications occurred in 80% of cases. Slight dilatation of the left ventricle was the most frequent complication (47.7%), followed by respiratory function disturbs (43.2%), microlithiasis or cholelithiasis (40.9%), increased flow velocity of cerebral arteries (31.8%), enuresis, delayed puberty and bone abnormalities (6.8% each), sickle cell retinopathy and leg ulcer (4.6% each) and recurrent priapism (2.3%). We identified a statistically significant association between leukocytes >15 000/μL and a higher number of hospitalizations (P < 0.001) and chronic complications of the disease (P = 0.035). The occurrence of dactylitis in first year of life was also significantly associated with a higher number of hospitalizations (P = 0.004) and chronic complications (P = 0.018). The presence of α-thalassemia was associated with a lower number of chronic complications (P = 0.036). Conclusions: Leucocytosis and dactylitis in the first year of life can be predictors of SCD severity, while the presence of α-thalassemia can be protective.

315,Susceptibility of induced sickle in samples of heterozygous hemoglobin S patients (sickle cell trait) suffering diabetes mellitus type 2 [Susceptibilidad de generar drepanocitos en muestras de pacientes heterocigotos para hemoglobina S (rasgo falciforme) que padecen diabetes mellitus tipo 2],2015,Gaceta Medica de Mexico,"Hemoglobin S is an abnormal protein that induces morphological changes in erythrocyte in low-oxygen conditions. In Mexico, it is reported that up to 13.7% of the population with mutation in one allele are considered asymptomatic (sickle cell trait).The sickle cell trait and diabetes mellitus are conditions that occur together in more than one million patients worldwide. Both diseases possibly produce microvascular changes in retinopathy and acute chest syndrome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the induction of sickle cells in samples of diabetic patients with sickle cell trait to identify altered red cell parameters. We obtained samples of diabetic patients to determine hemoglobin A1c and S; furthermore, red blood cell biometrics data were analyzed. We found that older men with diabetes were susceptible to generate sickle cells and this correlated with reduced red blood cell count and an increase in media cell volume. In samples of women diabetes, there were no differences We conclude that samples from patients with sickle cell trait and diabetes can cause sickle cells with high frequency in men, with lower red blood cells count and increased mean corpuscular volume as susceptibility parameters. © 2015, Academia Nacional de Medicina.

316,Increased circulating PEDF and low sICAM-1 are associated with sickle cell retinopathy,2015,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases","Sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) develops in up to 30% of sickle cell disease patients (SCD) during the second decade of life. Treatment for this affection remains palliative, so studies on its pathophysiology may contribute to the future development of novel therapies. SCR is more frequently observed in hemoglobin SC disease and derives from vaso-occlusion in the microvasculature of the retina leading to neovascularization and, eventually, to blindness. Circulating inflammatory cytokines, angiogenic factors, and their interaction may contribute to the pathophysiology of this complication. Angiopoietin (Ang)-1, Ang-2, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, E-selectin, P-selectin, IL1-β, TNF-α, pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF) and vascular endothelial growth factor plasmatic levels were determined in 37 SCD patients with retinopathy, 34 without retinopathy, and healthy controls. We observed that sICAM-1 is significantly decreased, whereas PEDF is elevated in HbSC patients with retinopathy (P=0.012 and P=0.031, respectively). Ang-1, Ang-2 and IL1-β levels were elevated in SCD patients (P=0.001, P<0.001 and P=0.001, respectively), compared to controls, and HbSS patients presented higher levels of Ang-2 compared to HbSC (P<0.001). Our study supports the possible influence of sICAM-1 and PEDF on the pathophysiology of retinal neovascularization in SCD patients. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

317,Key endothelial cell angiogenic mechanisms are stimulated by the circulating milieu in sickle cell disease and attenuated by hydroxyurea,2015,Haematologica,"As hypoxia-induced inflammatory angiogenesis may contribute to the manifestations of sickle cell disease, we compared the angiogenic molecular profiles of plasma from sickle cell disease individuals and correlated these with in vitro endothelial cell-mediated angiogenesis-stimulating activity and in vivo neovascularization. Bioplex demonstrated that plasma from patients with steady-state sickle cell anemia contained elevated concentrations of proangiogenic factors (angiopoietin-1, basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor-D and placental growth factor) and displayed potent pro-angiogenic activity, significantly increasing endothelial cell proliferation, migration and capillary-like structure formation. In vivo neovascularization of Matrigel plugs was significantly greater in sickle cell disease mice than in non-sickle cell disease mice, consistent with an up-regulation of angiogenesis in the disease. In plasma from patients with hemoglobin SC disease without proliferative retinopathy, anti-angiogenic endostatin and thrombospondin-2 were significantly elevated. In contrast, plasma from hemoglobin SC individuals with proliferative retinopathy had a pro-angiogenic profile and more significant effects on endothelial cell proliferation and capillary formation than plasma from patients without retinopathy. Hydroxyurea therapy was associated with significant reductions in plasma angiogenic factors and inhibition of endothelial cell-mediated angiogenic mechanisms and neovascularization. Thus, individuals with sickle cell anemia or hemoglobin SC disease with retinopathy present a highly angiogenic circulating milieu, capable of stimulating key endothelial cell-mediated angiogenic mechanisms. Combination anti-angiogenic therapy to prevent the progression of unregulated neovascularization and associated manifestations in sickle cell disease, such as pulmonary hypertension, may be indicated; furthermore, the benefits and drawbacks of the potent anti-angiogenic effects of hydroxyurea should be clarified. © 2015 Ferrata Storti Foundation.","['angiopoietin 1', '  basic fibroblast growth factor receptor', '  broxuridine', '  endostatin', '  hydroxyurea', '  matrigel', '  placental growth factor', '  thrombospondin', '  vasculotropin', '  vasculotropin D', '  antisickling agent', '  hydroxyurea', '  adult', '  angiogenesis', '  animal experiment', '  Article', '  cell invasion assay', '  cell migration', '  cell proliferation assay', '  clinical article', '  controlled study', '  endothelium cell', '  female', '  fluorescence angiography', '  human', '  human cell', '  male', '  mouse', '  neovascularization (pathology)', '  nonhuman', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  upregulation', '  adolescent', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  animal', '  blood', '  C57BL mouse', '  drug effects', '  endothelium cell', '  metabolism', '  middle aged', '  Neovascularization', ' Pathologic', '  transgenic mouse', '  umbilical vein endothelial cell', '  young adult', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Animals', '  Antisickling Agents', '  Endothelial Cells', '  Female', '  Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', '  Humans', '  Hydroxyurea', '  Male', '  Mice', '  Mice', ' Inbred C57BL', '  Mice', ' Transgenic', '  Middle Aged', '  Neovascularization', ' Pathologic', '  Young Adult']",29.0,Ferrata Storti Foundation,English,Article,"['Brazil', ' Portugal']",[],['Brazil'],2014 - 2023,2
318,The clinical significance of K-CL cotransport activity in red cells of patients with HbSC disease,2015,Haematologica,"HbSC disease is the second commonest form of sickle cell disease, with poorly understood pathophysiology and few treatments. We studied the role of K-Cl cotransport activity in determining clinical and laboratory features, and investigated its potential role as a biomarker. Samples were collected from 110 patients with HbSC disease and 41 with sickle cell anemia (HbSS). K-Cl cotransport activity was measured in the oxygenated (K-Cl cotransport100) and deoxygenated (K-Cl cotransport0) states, using radioactive tracer studies. K-Cl cotransport activity was high in HbSC and decreased significantly on deoxygenation. K-Cl cotransport activity correlated significantly and positively with the formation of sickle cells. On multiple regression analysis, K-Cl cotransport increased significantly and independently with increasing reticulocyte count and age. K-Cl cotransport activity was increased in patients who attended hospital with acute pain in 2011 compared to those who did not (K-Cl cotransport100: mean 3.87 versus 3.20, P=0.009, independent samples T-test; K-Cl cotransport0: mean 0.96 versus 0.68, P=0.037). On logistic regression only K-Cl cotransport was associated with hospital attendance. Increased K-Cl cotransport activity was associated with the presence of retinopathy, but this effect was confounded by age. This study links variability in a fundamental aspect of cellular pathology with a clinical outcome, suggesting that K-Cl cotransport is central to the pathology of HbSC disease. Increased K-Cl cotransport activity is associated with increasing age, which may be of pathophysiological significance. Effective inhibition of K-Cl cotransport activity is likely to be of therapeutic benefit. © 2015 Ferrata Storti Foundation.","['adult', '  age', '  Article', '  child', '  chloride transport', '  creatinine blood level', '  deoxygenation', '  erythrocyte', '  female', '  hemoglobin blood level', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  hospital admission', '  human', '  lactate dehydrogenase blood level', '  leukocyte count', '  logistic regression analysis', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  multiple linear regression analysis', '  oxygenation', '  pain', '  potassium transport', '  reticulocyte count', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  adolescent', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  erythrocyte disorder', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  hospitalization', '  metabolism', '  preschool child', '  young adult', '  cotransporter', '  potassium-chloride symporters', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Child', '  Child', ' Preschool', '  Erythrocytes', '  Erythrocytes', ' Abnormal', '  Female', '  Hemoglobin SC Disease', '  Hospitalization', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Symporters', '  Young Adult']",15.0,Ferrata Storti Foundation,English,Article,['United Kingdom'],[Medical Research Council],['United Kingdom'],2014 - 2023,1
319,Elevated hypercoagulability markers in hemoglobin SC disease,2015,Haematologica,"Hemoglobin SC disease is a very prevalent hemoglobinopathy; however, very little is known about this condition specifically. There appears to be an increased risk of thromboembolic events in hemoglobin SC disease, but studies evaluating the hemostatic alterations are lacking. We describe the findings of a cross-sectional observational study evaluating coagulation activation markers in adult patients with hemoglobin SC, comparing them with those in sickle cell anemia patients and healthy controls. A total of 56 hemoglobin SC and 39 sickle cell anemia patients were included in the study, all in steady state, and 27 healthy controls. None of the patients was taking hydroxyurea. Hemoglobin SC patients had a significantly up-regulated relative expression of tissue factor, as well as elevations in thrombin-antithrombin complex and D-dimer, in comparison to controls (P<0.01). Hemoglobin SC patients had lower tissue factor expression, and thrombin-antithrombin complex and D-dimer levels when compared to sickle cell anemia patients (P<0.05). Markers of endothelial activation (soluble thrombomodulin and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) and inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) were both significantly elevated in hemoglobin SC patients when compared to controls, being as high as the levels seen in patients with sickle cell anemia. Overall, in hemoglobin SC patients, higher hemolytic activity and inflammation were associated with a more intense activation of coagulation, and hemostatic activation was associated with two very prevalent chronic complications seen in hemoglobin SC disease: retinopathy and osteonecrosis. In summary, our results demonstrate that hemoglobin SC patients have a hypercoagulable state, although this manifestation was not as intense as that seen in sickle cell anemia. © 2015 Ferrata Storti Foundation.","['bilirubin', '  D dimer', '  hemoglobin', '  interleukin 8', '  lactate dehydrogenase', '  thrombin antithrombin complex', '  thrombomodulin', '  thromboplastin', '  tumor necrosis factor alpha', '  vascular cell adhesion molecule 1', '  autacoid', '  biological marker', '  thromboplastin', '  adult', '  Article', '  autosplenectomy', '  blood clotting', '  bone necrosis', '  controlled study', '  cross-sectional study', '  enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', '  hematocrit', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  hemolysis', '  hemostasis', '  human', '  hypercoagulability', '  inflammation', '  leukocyte count', '  major clinical study', '  monocyte', '  observational study', '  protein expression', '  pulmonary hypertension', '  real time polymerase chain reaction', '  reticulocyte count', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  spleen disease', '  thrombocyte count', '  upregulation', '  blood', '  blood clotting', '  complication', '  endothelium cell', '  female', '  gene expression', '  genetics', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  leukocyte', '  male', '  metabolism', '  middle aged', '  thrombophilia', '  Adult', '  Biomarkers', '  Blood Coagulation', '  Cross-Sectional Studies', '  Endothelial Cells', '  Female', '  Gene Expression', '  Hemoglobin SC Disease', '  Hemolysis', '  Humans', '  Inflammation Mediators', '  Leukocytes', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Thrombophilia', '  Thromboplastin']",22.0,Ferrata Storti Foundation,English,Article,['Brazil'],[],['Brazil'],2014 - 2023,1
320,Raman spectroscopy for a rapid diagnosis of sickle cell disease in human blood samples: a preliminary study,2015,Lasers in Medical Science,"Raman spectroscopy has been proposed as a tool for diagnosis of human blood diseases aiming a quick and accurate diagnosis. Sickle cell disease arises in infancy and causes a severe anemia; thus, an early diagnosis may avoid pathological complications such as vasoocclusion, hemolytic anemia, retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, and infections. This work evaluated spectral differences between hemoglobin S (HbS) and hemoglobin A (HbA) to be used in a diagnostic model based on principal components analysis. Blood samples of patients with a previous diagnosis of sickle cell disease were hemolyzed with water, centrifuged, and the pellet was collected with a pipette. Near-infrared Raman spectra (830 nm, 200 mW) were obtained from these samples, and a model based on principal components analysis and Mahalanobis distance were used to discriminate HbA from HbS. Differences were found in the spectra of HbS and HbA, mainly in the 882 and 1,373 cm−1 (valine, HbA) and 1,547 and 1,622 cm−1 (glutamic acid, HbS). The spectral model could correctly discriminate 100 % of the samples in the correspondent groups. Raman spectroscopy was able to detect the subtle changes in the polypeptide chain (valine and glutamic acid substitution) due to the sickle cell disease and could be used to discriminate blood samples with HbS from HbA with minimum sample preparations (hemolysis with water and centrifugation). © 2014, Springer-Verlag London.","['glutamic acid', '  hemoglobin A', '  hemoglobin S', '  valine', '  water', '  hemoglobin A', '  hemoglobin S', '  Article', '  blood sampling', '  controlled study', '  female', '  human', '  human cell', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  pipette', '  principal component analysis', '  priority journal', '  Raman spectrometry', '  sickle cell anemia', '  adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  blood', '  chemistry', '  hemolysis', '  reproducibility', '  statistical analysis', '  young adult', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Data Interpretation', ' Statistical', '  Female', '  Hemoglobin A', '  Hemoglobin', ' Sickle', '  Hemolysis', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Principal Component Analysis', '  Reproducibility of Results', '  Spectrum Analysis', ' Raman', '  Young Adult']",14.0,Springer London,English,Article,['Brazil'],[Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa],['Brazil'],2014 - 2023,1

322,Ocular Manifestations in Egyptian Children and Young Adults with Sickle Cell Disease,2014,Indian Journal of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,"In sickle cell disease (SCD), ocular lesions result from stasis and occlusion of small eye vessels by sickled erythrocytes. Vaso-occlusive disease of the retina can be responsible for nonproliferative (NPR) and proliferative retinopathy (PR). Patients are often asymptomatic until serious complications arise as, vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment. This work aimed to study the frequency and pattern of ocular manifestations in Egyptian children and young adults with SCD. In this cross-sectional study, 40 steady state patients (80 eyes) aged 2–28 years (30 children and 10 young adults) with established diagnosis of SCD (26 with homozygous SS and 14 with S/β thalassemia underwent complete ophthalmic examination with dilated fundoscopy. Fluorescein angiography was performed for patients ≥12 years old. The overall frequency of retinal lesions was 47.5 % (46.2 and 50 % of SS and S/β patients respectively). PR and NPR were evident in 32.5 and 27.5 % of all enrolled patients respectively (five patients having both). Peripheral retinal occlusion was a frequent ocular finding in both groups; the youngest patient showing PR was 15 years old. Older age, longer disease duration and splenectomy were significantly more prevalent among patients with PR. Despite lack of visual symptoms, children and young adults are at risk of PR. Frequency of retinal lesions was comparable in SS and S/β patients. Periodic ophthalmologic examination starting at the age of 12 years is recommended for timely-identification of retinal lesions thus minimizing the risk of sight threatening retinopathy. © 2014, Indian Society of Haematology & Transfusion Medicine.","['adult', '  age', '  Article', '  child', '  clinical article', '  controlled study', '  cross-sectional study', '  disease duration', '  Egypt', '  Egyptian', '  eye examination', '  female', '  fluorescence angiography', '  human', '  male', '  nonproliferative retinopathy', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  peripheral retinal occlusion', '  prevalence', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  refraction error', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell beta thalassemia', '  splenectomy', '  young adult']",13.0,Springer,English,Article,['Egypt'],[],['Egypt'],2014 - 2023,1
323,Plasma levels of some coagulation parameters in Steady State HBSC disease patients,2014,Pan African Medical Journal,"Introduction: sickle cell disease is a collection of autosomal recessive genetic disorders. It includes homozygous HbSS and double heterozygote combinations such as HbSC. Central and West Africa bears a significant burden of HbSC disease.Methods: prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen concentration (FC) and platelet count (PC) weredetermined in 41HbSC and HbSS patientsin steady state along with 40 apparently healthy HbAA controls. One way ANOVA test was used to compare means;p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Results: there was no significant difference in mean PT for the study groups (p = 0.192). Mean PC was highest in HbSS patients: 445.7 +/- 128.3 X 10 9/ L compared to HbSC: 330.0 +/- 97.7 X 10 9/ L andHbAA:245 +/- 77.7 X 10 9/ L (p= 0.000).Mean APTT was 28.1 +/- 3.8 seconds in controls,24.1+/- 66 seconds in HbSS patients and 21.8 +/- 3.8 seconds in HbSC patients (p = 0.000). Mean FCin HbSS was 1.6 +/- 0.7 g/L , 3.2 +/- 0.6 g/L in HbSC and 2.9 +/- 0.4 g/L in HbAA (p =0.000).Conclusion: a significant difference exists in PC, APTT and FC in HbSC patients compared to HbSS patients and HbAA controls. Elevated FC and shortened APTT may play a role in complications more characteristic of HbSC such as retinopathy and osteonecrosis. These suggestHbSC is not merely a milder form of HbSS; both diseases should be seen as different entities with regards to approaches for management. © 2014, Mauryne Debola Ajuwon et al.","['fibrinogen', '  fibrinogen', '  adult', '  analysis of variance', '  Article', '  blood clotting parameters', '  clinical article', '  controlled study', '  female', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  human', '  male', '  partial thromboplastin time', '  prothrombin time', '  sickle cell anemia', '  steady state', '  thrombocyte count', '  adolescent', '  blood', '  case control study', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  metabolism', '  young adult', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Case-Control Studies', '  Female', '  Fibrinogen', '  Hemoglobin SC Disease', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Partial Thromboplastin Time', '  Platelet Count', '  Prothrombin Time', '  Young Adult']",2.0,African Field Epidemiology Network,English,Article,['Ghana'],[],['Ghana'],2014 - 2023,1

The prevalence of chronic organ damages Increases as the age of patients followed in France. Few organs seem unaffected by the disease. The natural history of chronic complication is highly variable from one patient to another, and the distribution of those manifestations throughout life, Is different depending on their nature and pathophysiology. Thus we can, for example, distinguish SS patients presenting a ""hyperhemolytic"" phenotype associated with dense red blood cells that have a high risk of vascular complications including kidney disease, pulmonary hypertension, leg ulcers and priapism, from SC patients with high hemoglobin levels, who have a higher risk of retinopathy, osteonecrosis and sensory syndrome, probably related to hyperviscosity. Dependent on the age, we could also oppose cerebral vasculopathy responsible of ischemic stroke since childhood, and kidney damage which effects are visible more gradually with aging. Sickle cell disease is one of the most systemic pathologies contrasting with Its monogenic characteristic and its inter- and tntra-individual variability.

FINDINGS: Strong recommendations for preventive services include daily oral prophylactic penicillin up to the age of 5 years, annual transcranial Doppler examinations from the ages of 2 to 16 years in those with sickle cell anemia, and long-term transfusion therapy to prevent stroke in those children with abnormal transcranial Doppler velocity (≥200 cm/s). Strong recommendations addressing acute complications include rapid initiation of opioids for treatment of severe pain associated with a vasoocclusive crisis, and use of incentive spirometry in patients hospitalized for a vasoocclusive crisis. Strong recommendations for chronic complications include use of analgesics and physical therapy for treatment of avascular necrosis, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy for microalbuminuria in adults with SCD. Strong recommendations for children and adults with proliferative sickle cell retinopathy include referral to expert specialists for consideration of laser photocoagulation and for echocardiography to evaluate signs of pulmonary hypertension. Hydroxyurea therapy is strongly recommended for adults with 3 or more severe vasoocclusive crises during any 12-month period, with SCD pain or chronic anemia interfering with daily activities, or with severe or recurrent episodes of acute chest syndrome. A recommendation of moderate strength suggests offering treatment with hydroxyurea without regard to the presence of symptoms for infants, children, and adolescents. In persons with sickle cell anemia, preoperative transfusion therapy to increase hemoglobin levels to 10 g/dL is strongly recommended with a moderate strength recommendation to maintain sickle hemoglobin levels of less than 30% prior to the next transfusion during long-term transfusion therapy. A strong recommendation to assess iron overload is accompanied by a moderate strength recommendation to begin iron chelation therapy when indicated. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Hydroxyurea and transfusion therapy are strongly recommended for many individuals with SCD. Many other recommendations are based on quality of evidence that is less than high due to the paucity of clinical trials regarding screening, management, and monitoring for individuals with SCD.

Bevacizumab has been found to be effective in the treatment of these diseases. The aim of this study was to review all cases of intravitreal bevacizumab given in the retinal unit of the University College Hospital, Ibadan from July, 2010 to June 2012, pointing out the common indications. Methods: After obtaining ethical approval from the University College Hospital/University of Ibadan Review Board for the study, all cases of intravitreal injections of bevacizumab recorded in the retinal register during the study period (July 2010 to June 2012) were retrieved. Age, sex, diagnoses and indication for injection were recorded in the data sheet prepared for the study. Results were analyzed using proportions and percentages. Results: A total of one hundred and thirty four injections of bevacizumab were given in the study period. The most common indication was cystoid macular edema from retinal vein occlusion ([26(19.4%)] followed by wet age related maculopathy [23(17.1%)] and sickle cell retinopathy [(22(16.4)]. Emerging indications included idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy [8(6%) and retinal macroaneurism with macular edema [6(4.5%)].

334,Recommendations for the management of sickle cell disease in South Africa,2014,South African Medical Journal,"The spectrum of sickle cell disease (SCD) encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders that include: (i) homozygous SCD (HbSS), also referred to as sickle cell anaemia; (ii) heterozygous SCD (HbAS), also referred to as sickle cell trait; and (iii) compound heterozygous states such as HbSC disease, HbSβ thalassaemia, etc. Homozygous or compound heterozygous SCD patients manifest with clinical disease of varying severity that is influenced by biological and environmental factors, whereas subjects with sickle cell trait are largely asymptomatic. SCD is characterised by vaso-occlusive episodes that result in tissue ischaemia and pain in the affected region. Repeated infarctive episodes cause organ damage and may eventually lead to organ failure. For effective management, regular follow-up with support from a multidisciplinary healthcare team is necessary. The chronic nature of the disease, the steady increase in patient numbers, and relapsing acute episodes have cost implications that are likely to impact on provincial and national health budgets. Limited resources mandate local management protocols for the purposes of consistency and standardisation, which could also facilitate sharing of resources between centres for maximal utility. These recommendations have been developed for the South African setting, and it is intended to update them regularly to meet new demands and challenges. © 2014 Health & Medical Publishing Group.","['biological factor', '  butyric acid', '  clotrimazole', '  hydroxyurea', '  morphine', '  penicillin derivative', '  abdominal pain', '  acute chest syndrome', '  analgesia', '  Article', '  avascular necrosis', '  blood vessel occlusion', '  brain hemorrhage', '  cardiovascular disease', '  environmental factor', '  epilepsy', '  gallstone', '  gout', '  hematuria', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  human', '  immunization', '  infection control', '  ischemia', '  leg ulcer', '  nutrition', '  osteomyelitis', '  pain', '  practice guideline', '  priapism', '  pulmonary hypertension', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell beta thalassemia', '  sickle cell crisis', '  sickle cell trait', '  South Africa', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  disease management', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  practice guideline', '  procedures', '  sickle cell trait', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Disease Management', '  Hemoglobin SC Disease', '  Pain Management', '  Practice Guidelines as Topic', '  Sickle Cell Trait', '  South Africa']",13.0,South African Medical Association,English,Article,['South Africa'],[],['South Africa'],2014 - 2023,1

There are no strategies to prevent SR and treatments are extremely limited. The present study evaluated (1) the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell as a hemoglobin producer and novel cellular target for fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction, and (2) monomethylfumarate (MMF) as an HbF-inducing therapy and abrogator of oxidative stress and inflammation in SCD retina. Human globin gene expression was evaluated by RT-quantitative (q)PCR in the human RPE cell line ARPE-19 and in primary RPE cells isolated from Townes humanized SCD mice. γ-Globin promoter activity was monitored in KU812 stable dual luciferase reporter expressing cells treated with 0 to 1000 μM dimethylfumarate, MMF, or hydroxyurea (HU; positive control) by dual luciferase assay. Reverse transcriptase-qPCR, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), immunofluorescence, and Western blot techniques were used to evaluate γ-globin expression and HbF production in primary human erythroid progenitors, ARPE-19, and normal hemoglobin producing (HbAA) and homozygous β(s) mutation (HbSS) RPE that were treated similarly, and in MMF-injected (1000 μM) HbAA and HbSS retinas. Dihydroethidium labeling and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), IL-1β, and VEGF expression were also analyzed. Retinal pigment epithelial cells express globin genes and synthesize adult and fetal hemoglobin MMF stimulated γ-globin expression and HbF production in cultured RPE and erythroid cells, and in HbSS mouse retina where it also reduced oxidative stress and inflammation. The production of hemoglobin by RPE suggests the potential involvement of this cell type in the etiology of SR. Monomethylfumarate influences multiple parameters consistent with improved retinal health in SCD and may therefore be of therapeutic potential in SR treatment.

Results Nine patients had a sickle cell-hemoglobin C (SC) profile, 1 was sickle cell-beta+ thalassemia (S beta+-thal), and 4 were sickle cell trait (AS). All 15 eyes underwent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV): 6 for vitreous hemorrhage (VH), 1 for epiretinal membrane (ERM), and an additional 8 for tractional retinal detachment (RD) and/or rhegmatogenous RD. In addition, an encircling scleral buckle (SB) was used in 2 cases. In 7 cases, 20 gauge PPV was used; 23 gauge was used in 3; and 25 gauge was used in 5. All 7 eyes with VH or ERM had improved vision postoperatively. Four of the 8 patients with traction and/or rhegmatogenous RD developed recurrent detachments and required a second operation. All retinas were attached at last follow-up, and visual acuity was 20/400 or better in all eyes. No cases of anterior segment ischemia were encountered. Conclusions Anterior segment ischemia is no longer a common occurrence in eyes undergoing surgery for proliferative sickle retinopathy. Although PPV has replaced the use of SB in many situations, an encircling SB may still be used in this population when necessary. Surgery for VH and ERM generally results in favorable outcomes, but eyes undergoing surgery for traction/rhegmatogenous RD carry a more guarded prognosis. © 2014 BY ELSEVIER INC.

344,Severe proliferative retinopathy is associated with blood hyperviscosity in sickle cell hemoglobin-C disease but not in sickle cell anemia,2013,Clinical Hemorheology and Microcirculation,"Little is known about the impact of blood rheology on the occurrence of retinopathy in sickle cell disease (SCD). Fifty-nine adult SCD patients in steady-state condition participated to the study: 32 with homozygous SCD (sickle cell anemia; SCA) and 27 with sickle cell hemoglobin-C disease (SCC). The patients underwent retinal examination and were categorized according to the classification of Goldberg: 1) no retinopathy (group 1), 2) non-proliferative or proliferative stage I-II retinopathy (group 2) and 3) proliferative stage III-IV-V retinopathy (group 3). Hematological and hemorheological (whole blood viscosity, RBC deformability and aggregation properties) measurements were performed for each patient. In the whole SCD group (SCA + SCC patients) and in SCC patients, the group 3 had higher platelets count than group 2 but the difference between group 3 and group 1 did not reach statistical significance. No difference was observed for the other parameters between the three groups. SCC patients from the group 3 exhibited higher whole blood viscosity than SCC patients from the group 1. No significant difference was observed between the three groups in SCA patients.

If macular ischemia is not reversed, permanent vision loss can result. The authors report the successful use of exchange transfusion to treat unilateral paracentral occlusive retinopathy secondary to sickle cell disease in a 23-year-old man with hemoglobin SS disease. Initial presentation demonstrated arte-riolar occlusion, perivenous hemorrhages, vessel tortuosity, and areas of retinal ischemia. Visual acuity was count fingers, and the patient noted a paracentral scotoma.

349,Arginase in retinopathy,2013,Progress in Retinal and Eye Research,"Ischemic retinopathies, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinopathy of prematurity and retinal vein occlusion are a major cause of blindness in developed nations worldwide. Each of these conditions is associated with early neurovascular dysfunction. However, conventional therapies target clinically significant macula edema or neovascularization, which occur much later. Intra-ocular injections of anti-VEGF show promise in reducing retinal edema, but the effects are usually transient and the need for repeated injections increases the risk of intraocular infection. Laser photocoagulation can control pathological neovascularization, but may impair vision and in some patients the retinopathy continues to progress. Moreover, neither treatment targets early stage disease or promotes repair. This review examines the potential role of the ureahydrolase enzyme arginase as a therapeutic target for the treatment of ischemic retinopathy. Arginase metabolizes l-arginine to form proline, polyamines and glutamate. Excessive arginase activity reduces the l-arginine supply for nitric oxide synthase (NOS), causing it to become uncoupled and produce superoxide and less NO. Superoxide and NO react and form the toxic oxidant peroxynitrite. The catabolic products of polyamine oxidation and glutamate can induce more oxidative stress and DNA damage, both of which can cause cellular injury. Studies indicate that neurovascular injury during retinopathy is associated with increased arginase expression/activity, decreased NO, polyamine oxidation, formation of superoxide and peroxynitrite and dysfunction and injury of both vascular and neural cells. Furthermore, data indicate that the cytosolic isoform arginase I (AI) is involved in hyperglycemia-induced dysfunction and injury of vascular endothelial cells whereas the mitochondrial isoform arginase II (AII) is involved in neurovascular dysfunction and death following hyperoxia exposure. Thus, we postulate that activation of the arginase pathway causes neurovascular injury by uncoupling NOS and inducing polyamine oxidation and glutamate formation, thereby reducing NO and increasing oxidative stress, all of which contribute to the retinopathic process. © 2013.","['arginase', '  arginine', '  glutamic acid', '  nitric oxide synthase', '  peroxynitrite', '  polyamine', '  proline', '  reactive oxygen metabolite', '  superoxide', '  aging', '  allergic asthma', '  article', '  atherosclerosis', '  brain disease', '  cell death', '  chronic kidney disease', '  detoxification', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  DNA damage', '  endothelium cell', '  enzyme activity', '  erectile dysfunction', '  human', '  hyperglycemia', '  hyperoxia', '  hypertension', '  neoplasm', '  neovascularization (pathology)', '  nerve cell lesion', '  nerve degeneration', '  nerve regeneration', '  neuroprotection', '  nonhuman', '  oxidation', '  oxidative stress', '  pathophysiology', '  priority journal', '  prostate cancer', '  protein expression', '  reperfusion injury', '  retina vein occlusion', '  retinitis', '  retrolental fibroplasia', '  sickle cell anemia', '  traumatic brain injury', '  wound healing', '  Arginase', '  Diabetic retinopathy', '  Nitric oxide', '  Oxidative stress', '  Peroxynitrite', '  Polyamine', '  Retinopathy of prematurity', '  Superoxide', '  Animals', '  Arginase', '  Enzyme Inhibitors', '  Humans', '  Nitric Oxide', '  Nitric Oxide Synthase', '  Oxidative Stress', '  Retinal Diseases']",63.0,,English,Article,"['Georgia', ' United States']","[National Heart, Blood Institute, R01HL070215, National Eye Institute, R01EY011766, National Institute of Diabetes and, NIDDK, U.S. Department, Veterans Affairs, American Heart Association, AHA, Office of Research and Development, ORD, Health Services Research and Development, Biomedical Laboratory Research and Development, Office of Research and Development, ORD, Georgia Regents University, Royal Bank of Canada, RBC]",['United States'],2004 - 2013,2

Methods: Intravitreal bevacizumab was injected 3 days before the surgical procedure for traction retinal detachment. Vitrectomy, membrane peeling, endolaser, and SF6 gas tamponade were performed. A 37-year-old African American woman presented with hemoglobin sickle-cell disease and temporal retinal detachment with bullous subretinal fluid extending through the fovea associated with an area of active sea-fan retinal neovascularization with preretinal hemorrhage and retinal traction, with 3 associated retinal breaks. Results: The sea-fan neovascularization associated with the traction retinal detachment and the resultant retinal breaks appeared more fibrotic and les vascular than was noted prior to the pre-operative bevacizumab injection. Segmentation and dissection were performed with minimal bleeding, and retinal traction was relieved without difficulty. This was believed to be atypical in the experience of the surgeons. One month postoperatively, vision measured 20/50, and the retina remained attached. Conclusion: Further study is necessary to clarify the role of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor in the treatment of proliferative sickle cell retinopathy associated retinal detachment.

This study aimed to assess retinal changes in patients with SCD and its correlation with time-averaged mean flow velocity (TAMV) in middle cerebral arteries (MCA) and ophthalmic arteries (OA). Methods: Sixty SCD patients (aged 3-18 years) attending a paediatric hospital in Cairo, Egypt, during March 2010 to November 2011, were compared with 30 healthy controls. All underwent clinical and fundus examination by indirect ophthalmoscopy, and assessment of TAMV in MCAs and OAs by transcranial Doppler, repeated 1 year later for those with conditional velocities. Results: HbS/b was diagnosed in 32 patients and HbSS in 28; 50 patients had normal fundus and 10 had bilateral non-proliferative retinopathy. Risk factors for retinopathy included HbSS, age, previous stroke, noncompliant hydroxyurea (HU) therapy, frequency of sickling crises and HbS level. TAMVs were increased in MCAs, but not in OAs, in sicklers. TAMVs in MCAs and OAs increased with non-compliant HU therapy, previous stroke, age, frequency of sickling crises and level of HbS. No significant interhemispheric difference was found. Conclusion: Sickle retinopathy was correlated with TAMV in MCAs but not in OAs.

This disease affects millions of peoples globally which results in serious complications due to vasoocclusive phenomenon and haemolysis. This genetic abnormality is due to substitution of amino acid valine for the glutamic acid at the sixth position of beta chain of haemoglobin. This disease was described about one hundred year ago. The haemoglobin S (hbS) produced as result of this defect is poorly soluble and polymerized when deoxygenated. Symptoms of sickle cell disease are due to chronic anaemia, pain full crises, acute chest syndrome, stroke and susceptibility to bacterial infection. In recent years measures like prenatal screening, better medical care, parent education, immunization and penicillin prophylaxis have successfully reduced morbidity and mortality and have increased tremendously life expectancy of affected individuals. Three principal current therapeutics modalities available for childhood SCD are blood transfusion, Hydroxy urea and bone marrow transplantation. Genetic counseling, continued medical education for health professionals about sickle cell disease, its complications and management is necessary.

355,"Sickle cell disease, vasculopathy, and therapeutics",2013,Annual Review of Medicine,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a mutation in both beta globin genes, resulting in chronic hemolysis and multiorgan disease that ultimately leads to premature death. Although hemoglobin S (HbS) polymerization and vaso-occlusion are central to the pathogenesis of SCD, overlapping pathways implicated in SCD-related endothelial dysfunction include hemolysis, defects in nitric oxide metabolism, ischemiareperfusion injury, oxidative stress, increased cell-to-cell adhesion, and proinflammatory and coagulation mediators. Progression of organspecific vasculopathy often precedes organ dysfunction and may provide targets for therapeutic intervention. SCD-related vasculopathies include, but are not limited to, moyamoya that often precedes cerebral infarcts or hemorrhage, proliferative retinopathy prior to loss of eyesight, pulmonary vasculopathy associated with pulmonary hypertension, and renal vasculopathy prior to the onset of chronic renal disease.

356,Managing haematological disorders during pregnancy,2013,Best Practice and Research: Clinical Obstetrics and Gynaecology,"The management of patients with pre-existing haematological diseases during pregnancy can be particularly challenging. The potential maternal and foetal toxicities from treatment regimens including chemotherapy for malignant haematological disorders mean that joint management between obstetricians and haematologists is essential for achieving good outcomes for both mother and baby. Patients with inherited or acquired disorders of haemostasis including platelets (essential thrombocythaemia) and coagulation (antiphospholipid syndrome) resulting in a pro-thrombotic state also require special consideration as pregnancy is generally considered to be a pro-thrombotic condition which could exacerbate the pre-existing disorder. The choice, timing and duration of anticoagulation or anti-platelet therapy require careful coordination during the antenatal, perinatal as well as postnatal periods to ensure that both maternal and foetal risks are taken into consideration. Pregnancy in women with sickle cell disease has long been identified as high risk with medical and pregnancy related risks being more common compared to women without it. A range of foetal risks have also been reported but improvement in outcomes has been seen with better obstetric and haematological care and the emphasis on multidisciplinary teamwork.

Methods: Brief case report of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography imaging of a sea fan in a patient with sickle cell anemia and newly diagnosed proliferative sickle cell retinopathy, and morphologic comparison with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography imaging of a neovascular membrane in a diabetic patient with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Results: Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography imaging revealed that the sea fan is a thicker caliber preretinal fibrovascular membrane involving primarily the retinal nerve fiber and ganglion cell layers. The diabetic membrane has more vitreous adhesions, and it is more closely intertwined with the retina, involving all the retinal layers down to the outer plexiform layer. Conclusion: Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography imaging identified important in vivo morphologic differences between neovascularization in proliferative sickle cell retinopathy and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. These differences were consistent with previous histological studies and may explain the increased risk of tractional retinal detachment in patients with diabetes. © 2012 Ophthalmic Communications Society, Inc.",,2.0,,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2004 - 2013,1
359,The annexin A2/S100A10 system in health and disease: Emerging paradigms,2012,Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology,"Since its discovery as a src kinase substrate more than three decades ago, appreciation for the physiologic functions of annexin A2 and its associated proteins has increased dramatically. With its binding partner S100A10 (p11), A2 forms a cell surface complex that regulates generation of the primary fibrinolytic protease, plasmin, and is dynamically regulated in settings of hemostasis and thrombosis. In addition, the complex is transcriptionally upregulated in hypoxia and promotes pathologic neoangiogenesis in the tissues such as the retina. Dysregulation of both A2 and p11 has been reported in examples of rodent and human cancer. Intracellularly, A2 plays a critical role in endosomal repair in postarthroplastic osteolysis, and intracellular p11 regulates serotonin receptor activity in psychiatric mood disorders. In human studies, the A2 system contributes to the coagulopathy of acute promyelocytic leukemia, and is a target of high-titer autoantibodies in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, cerebral thrombosis, and possibly preeclampsia. Polymorphisms in the human ANXA2 gene have been associated with stroke and avascular osteonecrosis of bone, two severe complications of sickle cell disease. Together, these new findings suggest that manipulation of the annexin A2/S100A10 system may offer promising new avenues for treatment of a spectrum of human disorders. © 2012 Nadia Hedhli et al.","['binding protein', '  lipocortin 2', '  s100a10 protein', '  unclassified drug', '  lipocortin 2', '  protein S 100', '  S100 calcium binding protein A10', '  abortion', '  antibody titer', '  antiphospholipid syndrome', '  atherosclerosis', '  avascular necrosis', '  blood clotting disorder', '  bone atrophy', '  brain ischemia', '  cardiovascular disease', '  cell surface', '  disease association', '  disease severity', '  fibrinolysis', '  hemoglobinopathy', '  human', '  mental disease', '  mood disorder', '  nonhuman', '  occlusive cerebrovascular disease', '  postarthroplastic osteolysis', '  preeclampsia', '  promyelocytic leukemia', '  retinopathy', '  review', '  sickle cell anemia', '  single nucleotide polymorphism', '  solid tumor', '  transcription regulation', '  animal', '  disease model', '  diseases', '  health', '  metabolism', '  Rodentia', '  Animals', '  Annexin A2', '  Disease', '  Disease Models', ' Animal', '  Health', '  Humans', '  S100 Proteins']",69.0,,English,Review,"['Mexico', ' United States']","[National Heart, Blood Institute]",['United States'],2004 - 2013,2
360,Ophthalmic manifestations of sickle cell disease: Update of the latest findings,2012,Current Opinion in Ophthalmology,"Purpose of Review: Recent developments in the diagnosis and management of sickle cell ocular manifestations are reviewed to enable the clinician to better manage the ophthalmic care of these patients. Recent Findings: Research over the past year has focused upon systemic and ocular clues to the presence of sickle cell retinopathy. In addition, newer imaging modalities, such as spectral domain optical coherence tomography and wide-field imaging, have resulted in the detection of subclinical retinopathy related to sickle cell disease. Decreased retinal function (via microperimetry testing) has also been detected in association with areas of retinal thinning. Identification of these ocular and systemic factors that are associated with sickle cell retinopathy will help identify those patients who most need to be screened for sickle cell retinopathy. Summary: The awareness of subclinical disease as well as the identification of systemic factors associated with higher prevalence of sickle cell retinopathy will aid the clinician in identifying those patients who are at higher risk of retinopathy. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","['anterior eye segment', '  clinical feature', '  conjunctiva disease', '  eye disease', '  eye photography', '  fluorescence angiography', '  glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency', '  human', '  hyphema', '  intraocular pressure abnormality', '  iridocyclitis', '  orbit cellulitis', '  perimetry', '  prevalence', '  priority journal', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  retina detachment', '  review', '  sickle cell anemia', '  spectral domain optical coherence tomography', '  visual acuity', '  vitreous hemorrhage', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Humans', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Tomography', ' Optical Coherence', '  Vision', ' Ocular', '  Visual Field Tests', '  Visual Fields']",21.0,,English,Review,['United States'],[],['United States'],2004 - 2013,1

Methods: Patients with sickle cell anemia over the age of seven were examined. Complete ophthalmologic examination with indirect ophthalmoscopy and angiography was performed in each patient. The fundoscopy results were grouped in 3 classes: normal; non- -proliferative retinopathy, which includes vascular tortuosity, black sunburst, salmon-patch and peripheral closure/anastomoses; and proliferative retinopathy, related to neovascular proliferation. Angiography results were classified according to Goldberg classifications from stage I to V. Results: Retinopathy related to sickle cell anemia was seen in 62.3% (38/61) of the eyes checked. Neovascularization was observed in one eye. Thefrequency of bilateral changes in angiography was high. Non-proliferative retinopathy wasmore common, especially vascular tortuosities (17/61), followed by arteriovenous anastomoses in the retinal periphery (15/61) and arterial occlusions (5/61). The mean age of retinopathy group was 14.4 years old, significantly lower than the mean age of non-retinopathy group, which was 17.4. The result was normal in16.4% (10/61) of the eyes in the fundoscopy exam, while angiography showed alterations. Conclusions: All the results pointed to the conclusion that the non-proliferative retinal vascular changes are frequent and precocious in patients with sickle cell anemia (SS genotype). Fluorescein angiography is more sensitive in the diagnosis of retinopathy when compared to indirect ophthalmoscopy.","['adolescent', '  adult', '  article', '  Brazil', '  child', '  comparative study', '  cross-sectional study', '  female', '  fluorescence angiography', '  human', '  male', '  pathology', '  retina disease', '  severity of illness index', '  sickle cell anemia', '  university hospital', '  young adult', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Brazil', '  Child', '  Cross-Sectional Studies', '  Female', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Hospitals', ' University', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Severity of Illness Index', '  Young Adult']",3.0,,Portuguese,Article,['Brazil'],[],['Brazil'],2004 - 2013,1
364,Sickle cell disease in pregnancy,2012,"Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Reproductive Medicine","Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive condition, which leads to life-long haemolytic anaemia. Clinical features are intermittent episodes of severe pain and chronic complications including a high risk of stroke, renal dysfunction, retinopathy and cardiopulmonary disease. Advances in treatment have enabled affected women to live to childbearing age. Pregnancy and childbirth with SCD are considered high-risk, and are associated with increased maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. A universal newborn screening programme provides for early identification of all affected newborns. The antenatal screening programme identifies women with haemoglobinopathies and offers them the option of fetal screening. Management of women with SCD begins with preconceptual care, which involves counselling, screening for end organ damage and a review of their medications. Multidisciplinary antenatal care is desirable. Contraception should be discussed post pregnancy. The only proven cure for this condition is correction of the genetic defect by haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. © 2012.","['acetylsalicylic acid', '  antibiotic agent', '  erythromycin', '  Haemophilus influenzae vaccine', '  hemoglobin', '  hemoglobin S', '  hepatitis B vaccine', '  hydroxyurea', '  levonorgestrel', '  Meningococcus vaccine', '  nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent', '  opiate', '  paracetamol', '  penicillin G', '  Pneumococcus vaccine', '  acute chest syndrome', '  anemia', '  antibiotic prophylaxis', '  article', '  bacterial infection', '  blood pressure monitoring', '  clinical feature', '  echocardiography', '  endocrine disease', '  erythrocyte membrane', '  erythrocyte shape', '  erythrocyte transfusion', '  ethnicity', '  female', '  fluid intake', '  gallstone', '  gene frequency', '  genetic counseling', '  Haemophilus infection', '  hepatitis B', '  human', '  iron overload', '  maternal mortality', '  meningococcosis', '  metabolic disorder', '  molecular pathology', '  newborn screening', '  pain', '  patient counseling', '  pregnancy', '  pregnancy outcome', '  pregnant woman', '  prenatal care', '  prenatal screening', '  retinopathy', '  screening test', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell crisis', '  single drug dose', '  stem cell transplantation', '  stroke', '  urinalysis', '  vaccination']",5.0,,English,Article,['United Kingdom'],[],['United Kingdom'],2004 - 2013,1
365,Hemoglobin sickle cell disease complications: A clinical study of 179 cases,2012,Haematologica,"Background Hemoglobin sickle cell disease is one of the most frequent hemoglobinopathies. Surprisingly, few studies have been dedicated to this disease, currently considered to be a mild variant of homozygous sickle cell disease. The aim of this study was to update our knowledge about hemoglobin sickle cell disease. Design and Methods The study involved a single center series of 179 patients. Clinical and biological data were collected with special attention to the assessment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and nephropathy. Results Hemoglobin sickle cell diagnosis was delayed and performed in adulthood in 29% of cases. Prevalence of hospitalized painful vasoocclusive crisis, acute chest syndrome and priapism was 36%, 20% and 20%, respectively. The most common chronic organ complications were retinopathy and sensorineural otological disorders in 70% and 29% of cases. Indeed, prevalence of complications reported in homozygous sickle cell disease, such as nephropathy, suspicion of pulmonary hypertension, strokes and leg ulcers was rather low (13%, 4% and 1%, respectively). Phlebotomy performed in 36% of this population (baseline hemoglobin 11.5 g/dL) prevented recurrence of acute events in 71% of cases. Conclusions Our data suggest that hemoglobin sickle cell disease should not be considered as a mild form of sickle cell anemia but as a separate disease with a special emphasis on viscosity-associated otological and ophthalmological disorders, and with a low prevalence of vasculopathy (strokes, pulmonary hypertension, ulcers and nephropathy). Phlebotomy was useful in reducing acute events and a wider use of this procedure should be further investigated. © 2012 Ferrata Storti Foundation.","['albumin', '  hemoglobin', '  hydroxyurea', '  acute chest syndrome', '  adult', '  aged', '  artery thrombosis', '  article', '  blood vessel occlusion', '  bone necrosis', '  clinical assessment', '  Doppler flowmetry', '  echocardiography', '  female', '  glomerulus filtration rate', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  human', '  kidney disease', '  kidney papilla necrosis', '  leg ulcer', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  observational study', '  perception deafness', '  phlebotomy', '  prevalence', '  priapism', '  pulmonary hypertension', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  stroke', '  transfusion', '  venous thromboembolism', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Aged', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Female', '  Hemoglobins', '  Humans', '  Hypertension', ' Pulmonary', '  Kidney Diseases', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Phlebotomy', '  Prevalence', '  Young Adult']",96.0,,English,Article,['France'],[],['France'],2004 - 2013,1

The prevalence of sickle-cell retinopathy in patients followed in a referral center is presented in this study. Patients and methods: The prevalence of proliferative sickle-cell retinopathy by Goldberg classification was determined via a retrospective study of primarily adult SS and SC sickle-cell disease patients and AS sickle trait patients followed in a single referral center for a mean period of 13 years. All patients underwent slit lamp examination and complete fundus examination. Results: Seven hundred and thirty patients (mean age 32.5 ± 10 years), consisting of 492 SS patients (67.4%), 229 SC patients (31.4%) and nine AS patients (1.2%), were included in the study. 54.6% of SC patients and 18.1% of SS patients had grade 3 to 5 proliferative sickle-cell retinopathy. The prevalence of severe forms of sickle-cell retinopathy was higher among SS men than among SS women (21.7% versus 15.5% ; P < 0.05).

369,Association of coagulation activation with clinical complications in sickle cell disease,2012,PLoS ONE,"Background: The contribution of hypercoagulability to the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease (SCD) remains poorly defined. We sought to evaluate the association of markers of coagulation and platelet activation with specific clinical complications and laboratory variables in patients with SCD. Design and Methods: Plasma markers of coagulation activation (D-dimer and TAT), platelet activation (soluble CD40 ligand), microparticle-associated tissue factor (MPTF) procoagulant activity and other laboratory variables were obtained in a cohort of patients with SCD. Tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity was determined by Doppler echocardiography and the presence/history of clinical complications was ascertained at the time of evaluation, combined with a detailed review of the medical records. Results: No significant differences in the levels of D-dimer, TAT, soluble CD40 ligand, and MPTF procoagulant activity were observed between patients in the SS/SD/Sβ0 thalassemia and SC/Sβ+ thalassemia groups. Both TAT and D-dimer were significantly correlated with measures of hemolysis (lactate dehydrogenase, indirect bilirubin and hemoglobin) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. In patients in the SS/SD/Sβ0 thalassemia group, D-dimer was associated with a history of stroke (p = 0.049), TAT was associated with a history of retinopathy (p = 0.0176), and CD40 ligand was associated with the frequency of pain episodes (p = 0.039). In multivariate analyses, D-dimer was associated with reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, NT-proBNP and history of stroke; soluble CD40 ligand was associated with WBC count and platelet count; and MPTF procoagulant activity was associated with hemoglobin and history of acute chest syndrome. Conclusions: This study supports the association of coagulation activation with hemolysis in SCD. The association of D-dimer with a history of stroke suggests that coagulation activation may contribute to the pathophysiology of stroke in clinically severe forms of SCD. More research is needed to evaluate the contribution of coagulation and platelet activation to clinical complications in SCD. © 2012 Ataga et al.","['amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide', '  bilirubin', '  CD40 ligand', '  D dimer', '  hemoglobin', '  lactate dehydrogenase', '  microparticle associated tissue factor', '  thromboplastin', '  transactivator protein', '  unclassified drug', '  vascular cell adhesion molecule 1', '  antithrombin', '  biological marker', '  fibrin degradation product', '  fibrin fragment d', '  lactate dehydrogenase', '  thrombin', '  thromboplastin', '  vascular cell adhesion molecule 1', '  acute chest syndrome', '  adult', '  beta thalassemia', '  bilirubin blood level', '  blood clotting', '  cohort analysis', '  controlled study', '  cross-sectional study', '  disease association', '  Doppler echocardiography', '  female', '  hemoglobin blood level', '  hemolysis', '  human', '  hypercoagulability', '  laboratory test', '  lactate dehydrogenase blood level', '  leukocyte count', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  medical history', '  medical record review', '  pain', '  pathophysiology', '  protein blood level', '  protein function', '  reticulocyte count', '  retinopathy', '  review', '  sickle cell anemia', '  stroke', '  thrombocyte activation', '  thrombocyte count', '  tricuspid valve regurgitation', '  article', '  blood', '  demography', '  enzymology', '  membrane microparticle', '  metabolism', '  multivariate analysis', '  physiology', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Antithrombins', '  Biological Markers', '  Blood Coagulation', '  Cell-Derived Microparticles', '  Demography', '  Female', '  Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products', '  Humans', '  L-Lactate Dehydrogenase', '  Male', '  Multivariate Analysis', '  Platelet Activation', '  Thrombin', '  Thromboplastin', '  Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1']",77.0,,English,Review,['United States'],"[National Heart, Blood Institute]",['United States'],2004 - 2013,1

The objective of this study was to determine frequency and pattern of retinopathy in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients at tertiary care settings in Abbottabad. This was a descriptive cross-sectional comparative study being conducted at Ayub Teaching Hospital and Northern Institute of Medical Sciences Abbottabad. It included 100 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients who were attending diabetic clinics of these tertiary care hospitals. Already diagnosed type 2 patients taking anti-diabetic medication, type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, retinal vasculitis, retinal vessel occlusion, and sickle cell retinopathy were excluded. After pupillary dilatation, detailed fundoscopic examination was carried out via direct ophthalmoscopy and further confirmed by an ophthalmologist. According to fundoscopic findings, retinopathy was graded into background, pre-proliferative and proliferative types. Total 100 patients were included, with mean age 45.1 +/- 3.2 years, 60% of them were females. Overall, 17% of type 2 diabetic patients had retinopathy within one month of diagnosis. Background retinopathy was predominant (12%) followed by pre-proliferative (4%) and proliferative (1%) lesions. Frequency of retinopathy in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients seems to be higher than previous reports and background lesions were predominant.

The secondary purpose was to identify ocular changes, their frequency and stage of evolution. Methods: 90 patients aged between 8 and 75 years were evaluated. They were subjected to complete ophthalmological examination, indirect ophthalmoscopy, retinography, angiography and electroretinography. Electroretinograms with amplitude of wave b less than 400 mW were considered subnormal. Prevalence study was conducted using the Chi-square test, P<0.001. Results: The electroretinogram was subnormal in 27 (30%) of 90 patients, but of these, only 4 (4.4%) had proliferative retinopathy. The sign of comma in 95% of individuals, the retinal vascular tortuosity in 36.6% and black sunburst in 24.4% were the most frequent changes. Conclusion: No correlation between sickle cell disease and electroretinographics changes, as described in other studies, were noted. On the other hand, the ocular findings corroborate the previous researches.","['adolescent', '  adult', '  aged', '  article', '  child', '  electroretinography', '  female', '  genetics', '  human', '  male', '  middle aged', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Aged', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Child', '  Electroretinography', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Young Adult']",6.0,,Portuguese,Article,['Brazil'],[],['Brazil'],2004 - 2013,1
376,Clinical and laboratory factors associated with the severity of proliferative sickle cell retinopathy in patients with sickle cell hemoglobin C (SC) and homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease,2011,Medicine,"Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (PSCR) is the most frequent vision-threatening complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). We investigated the relationship between the severity of sickle cell retinopathy in heterozygous (SC) or homozygous (SS) adult SCD patients and the clinical and laboratory data obtained during visits to a national SCD referral center. This retrospective longitudinal analysis included 942 SCD patients (313 patients with SC and 629 with SS disease) with ophthalmologic evaluations who were followed over a 19-year period by a multidisciplinary team in a referral center. PSCR was graded using the Goldberg classification. We identified patient and SCD characteristics associated with sickle cell retinopathy severity using multinomial logistic-regression models. Multivariate analysis associated severe PSCR forms (stages III-V) with older age (p = 0.032), pulmonary involvement (documented pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary arterial pressure ≥ 40 mm Hg, restrictive syndrome >20%, or previous history of pulmonary embolism diagnosed by vascular imaging) (p = 0.029), deafness or tinnitus (p = 0.026), and no history of osteomyelitis (p = 0.013) for SC patients; and with older age (p < 0.001), male sex (p = 0.003), and acute pyelonephritis (p = 0.04) for SS patients. The model of severe PSCR versus no PSCR showed good calibration and discrimination for SC and SS patients. Awareness of the clinical and laboratory factors significantly associated with severe PSCR in patients with SC or SS SCD may contribute to improved preventive strategies. © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","['ferritin', '  hemoglobin', '  hemoglobin F', '  iron', '  acute chest syndrome', '  acute pyelonephritis', '  adolescent', '  adult', '  age', '  aged', '  article', '  bone necrosis', '  child', '  cholecystectomy', '  disease classification', '  disease severity', '  dizziness', '  eye examination', '  female', '  ferritin blood level', '  follow up', '  Goldberg classification', '  hearing impairment', '  hemoglobin blood level', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  human', '  infection', '  iron blood level', '  lung artery pressure', '  lung embolism', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  mean corpuscular volume', '  osteomyelitis', '  priority journal', '  proliferative sickle cell retinopathy', '  pulmonary hypertension', '  retinopathy', '  school child', '  sex difference', '  sickle cell anemia', '  stroke', '  thrombophlebitis', '  tinnitus', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Aged', '  Child', '  Female', '  Hemoglobin SC Disease', '  Humans', '  Logistic Models', '  Longitudinal Studies', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Multivariate Analysis', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retrospective Studies', '  Young Adult']",28.0,,English,Article,['France'],[],['France'],2004 - 2013,1

To determine the magnitude and pattern of ocular manifestations in sickle cell disease at Korle-bu Hospital, Accra, Ghana. Methods. Hospital-based cross-sectional study including all patients with sickle cell disease reporting for routine follow-up at the Sickle Cell Clinic at Korle-bu Hospital, Accra, Ghana. Results. A total of 201 patients with sickle cell disease (67 male and 134 female) were enrolled, comprising 114 subjects with genotype HbSS, aged 6-58 years, mean 19.26 (SD 11.70), and 87 with genotype HbSC, aged 6-65 years, mean 31.4 (SD 16.76). Visual impairment was found in 5.6% of eyes examined. Causes were cataract, proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR), optic atrophy, phthisis bulbi, and central retinal artery occlusion. Common anterior segment signs of sickle cell disease, which were more common in HbSC patients, were tortuous corkscrew conjunctival vessels, iris atrophy, and cataract. Eyes with iris atrophy or depigmentation were 1.8 times more at risk of PSR than eyes without. Overall, PSR was found in 12.9% of subjects examined (3.5% of HbSS, 25.3% of HbSC; 15.9% of males and 11.2% of females). The prevalence of proliferative sickle retinopathy increased with age and increased systemic severity of sickle cell disease; sex did not have an influence. Conclusions. There is a high prevalence of ocular morbidity in sickle cell disease patients at Korle-bu Hospital.

380,Detection and monitoring of sickle cell retinopathy using ultra wide-field color photography and fluorescein angiography,2011,Retina,"Purpose: In this study, we demonstrate the use of wide-field photography and fluorescein angiography to visualize the peripheral vascular changes and to identify patients with risk factors for developing proliferative sickle cell retinopathy. Methods: This is a retrospective case series of 12 eyes of 6 patients with sickle cell disease. Visual acuity testing, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, dilated fundus examinations, and noncontact wide-field fundus photography and fluorescein angiography using Optomap scanning laser ophthalmoscope (Optos, Marlborough, MA) were performed in all patients. The retinopathy was classified into proliferative and nonproliferative retinopathies, and the extent of retinopathy was measured in degrees. Wide-field images obtained using Optomap were compared with the derived seven-standard field images. Results: At the time of initial examination, 50% of the total eyes had proliferative retinopathy. All the peripheral retinas and vasculature were easily imaged within a single frame with Optomap. Six eyes met the high-risk criteria for developing proliferative changes. None of the eyes in our case series had tractional retinal detachment. The degrees of any type of sickle cell retinopathy and active neovascularization ranged from 20° to 360° and 10° to 60°, respectively. In all but one eye, wide-field images detected peripheral vascular changes missed on the seven-standard field photographs.

381,The paradox of the neutrophil's role in tissue injury,2011,Journal of Leukocyte Biology,"The neutrophil is an essential component of the innate immune system, and its function is vital to human life. Its production increases in response to virtually all forms of inflammation, and subsequently, it can accumulate in blood and tissue to varying degrees. Although its participation in the inflammatory response is often salutary by nature of its normal interaction with vascular endothelium and its capability to enter tissues and respond to chemotactic gradients and to phagocytize and kill microrganisms, it can contribute to processes that impair vascular integrity and blood flow. The mechanisms that the neutrophil uses to kill microorganisms also have the potential to injure normal tissue under special circumstances. Its paradoxical role in the pathophysiology of disease is particularly, but not exclusively, notable in seven circumstances: 1) diabetic retinopathy, 2) sickle cell disease, 3) TRALI, 4) ARDS, 5) renal microvasculopathy, 6) stroke, and 7) acute coronary artery syndrome. The activated neutrophil's capability to become adhesive to endothelium, to generate highly ROS, and to secrete proteases gives it the potential to induce local vascular and tissue injury. In this review, we summarize the evidence for its role as a mediator of tissue injury in these seven conditions, making it or its products potential therapeutic targets. © Society for Leukocyte Biology.","['beta2 integrin', '  CD18 antigen', '  endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1', '  endothelin 1', '  integrin', '  intercellular adhesion molecule 1', '  L selectin', '  selectin', '  vascular cell adhesion molecule 1', '  acute coronary syndrome', '  acute lung injury', '  adult respiratory distress syndrome', '  apoptosis', '  bleeding', '  blood flow', '  blood transfusion', '  blood vessel injury', '  cell interaction', '  cerebrovascular disease', '  chemotaxis', '  coronary artery disease', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  fibrosis', '  glomerulonephritis', '  heart muscle cell', '  human', '  hyperglycemia', '  innate immunity', '  leukocyte activation', '  leukocyte adherence', '  leukocyte function', '  leukocyte migration', '  leukocytosis', '  leukostasis', '  neutropenia', '  neutrophil', '  neutrophilia', '  nonhuman', '  pathophysiology', '  priority journal', '  protein expression', '  renovascular disease', '  review', '  sickle cell anemia', '  stroke', '  T lymphocyte', '  tissue injury', '  transfusion related acute lung injury', '  vascular endothelium', '  vasculitis', '  Animals', '  Disease', '  Humans', '  Models', ' Immunological', '  Neutrophils', '  Organ Specificity', '  Wounds and Injuries']",228.0,,English,Review,['United States'],"[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, R00NS060764]",['United States'],2004 - 2013,1
382,Pediatric sickle cell retinopathy: Correlation with clinical factors,2011,Journal of AAPOS,"Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) occurs in 1 of every 500 African American births and 1 of every 36,000 Hispanic American births. Of children with SCD, 16.7% to 96.3% develop sickle retinopathy (SR). This study was designed to determine whether certain factors are associated with SR and whether SR is correlated with a greater incidence of other SCD manifestations. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of 258 children with SCD seen in the ophthalmology clinic at a large urban children's hospital. Of these, 54 children with SR were matched for age and sickle variant with 54 children with normal examinations. Data extracted included demographics, type of retinopathy, presence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, and history of acute chest syndrome, transfusions, pulmonary hypertension, renal disease, cerebrovascular accident, aplastic crisis, splenic sequestration, priapism, osteonecrosis, gallstones, pneumonia, leg ulcers, vaso-occlusive pain crises, and death. Results: Of the children with SR, 11 (20.3%) had active proliferative disease, 32 (56.1%) had hemoglobin SS, 18 (31.6%) had hemoglobin SC, and 4 (7.0%) had hemoglobin S-beta thalassemia. Several factors were correlated with retinopathy: pain crisis (odds ratio [OR], 5.00; p = 0.011), male sex (OR, 4.20, p = 0.004), and splenic sequestration (OR, 4.00; p = 0.013). G6PD deficiency was more common in patients with retinopathy, although this was not statistically significant (OR, 4.20; p = 0.054). No other factors, including frequency of pain crisis, were statistically significant. Conclusions: Patients with pain crisis and splenic sequestration should be considered for early ophthalmic evaluation. Those with G6PD deficiency may also deserve early screening. By identifying patients at high risk for SR, we can refine screening protocols to safeguard patients from vision loss.

A 3-year, 6-month-old boy presented with leukocoria in the left eye, left esotropia, and dense free-floating white vitreous cells obscuring the fundus, suspicious for endophytic retinoblastoma. Ultrasonography depicted dense debris in the vitreous with no distinct calcific echo or retinal mass. Transcorneal, transzonular fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the vitreous confirmed the presence of dehemoglobinized vitreous red blood cells without tumor. The opposite eye showed peripheral retinal pigment epithelial proliferation and fibrosis with angiographic peripheral ischemia. Hemoglobin electrophoresis disclosed sickle trait (AS). The findings were classified as proliferative sickle cell retinopathy with vitreous hemorrhage in the left eye and non-proliferative sickle cell retinopathy in the right eye. Leukocoria generally raises warnings for retinoblastoma, but can also reflect chronic vitreous hemorrhage.

Among them we find the sickle cell aneamia that presents its main harmful effect on the peripheral vasculature. In the retina, the falciform lesions have a well defined physiopathology and classification. To identify the retinal manifestations caused by the falciform aneamia in patients directed to the Bettina Ferro de Souza Hospital from the Hemocenter of the State of Pará - HEMOPA, in the months of September through December of 2006. Methods: Ophthalmologic examination was performed in the Department of Ophthalmology of the Bettina Ferro de Souza Hospital. and fifty patients with sickle cell aneamia (SS or SC) followed by the department of falciform aneamia of the Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Pará - HEMOPA have been randomly selected and submitted to interview in order to register their: sex; age; color; genotype; ocular alterations; medicines taken. Ophthalmologic examination was performed in the Department of Ophthalmology of the Bettina Ferro de Souza Hospital. It consisted of: evaluation of the acuity of vision with and without correction, indirect biomicroscopy, indirect binocular ophthalmoscopy, and, in case the latter presented alterations, a complementary study with angiofluoresceinography would be carried through. Results: The outcomes have been registered in research protocol and later submitted to the statistic analysis using the Qui-square test, adopting, as level of significance, p<0,05. Eighty-eight percent of the patients did not present any falciform retinal sign, 3% presented peripheral vascular occlusion; in 2%, pigmented plate was shown, and 7% presented injuries which were not compatible with the falciform disease; there was a proportionality of 50% for males and females; there was a higher predominance (38%) of people aged from 11 and 15; 74% had SS genotype and 26% SC genotype; in relation to the use of medicines there was a higher prevalence of ocular alterations in patients who had made use of the folic acid isolated, with 5%, in contrast with those who had used the hidroxyurea association and folic acid, when all (27%) presented normal fundoscopic examination; all the patients (29%) that showed fetal hemoglobin rate above 10% had retina without alterations. Conclusion: Few cases of retinal signs have been observed in the studied group, however this research does not diminish the importance of early and periodic ophthalmologic examination, since falciform retinopathy is largely registered and its complications can lead to amaurosis.",,1.0,Sociedade Brasileira de Oftalmologia,Portuguese,Article,['Brazil'],[],['Brazil'],2004 - 2013,1
386,Structural and functional correlation in sickle cell retinopathy using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and scanning laser ophthalmoscope microperimetry,2011,American Journal of Ophthalmology,"Purpose: To correlate macular structural changes by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) with functional changes by scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) microperimetry testing in patients with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies. Design: Prospective, investigational study. Methods: Patients with electrophoretic confirmation of sickle cell hemoglobinopathies and normal subjects underwent SD-OCT and microperimetry testing with the OPKO Spectral OCT/SLO instrument. Based on SD-OCT findings, patients were grouped into those with focal macular thinning (Group A) and those without (Group B). Main outcome measure were mean retinal sensitivities measured by microperimetry and mean macular thicknesses in the 9 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like subfields. Results: Thirty-seven eyes of 19 patients with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies (SS, SC, and S-thalassemia) and 34 eyes of 34 age-similar normal controls were included. Mean age and mean logMAR best-corrected visual acuity between Groups A and B were not statistically different (39.7 years vs 36.5 years, P =.64 and 0.015 vs 0.016, P =.93, respectively). Group A had significantly thinner retinas compared to Group B in the parafoveal superior (P =.019), parafoveal temporal (P <.004), parafoveal inferior (P =.003), perifoveal superior (P =.04), perifoveal temporal (P =.0005), and perifoveal inferior (P =.045) subfields. The overall mean microperimetry retinal sensitivities of Group A were significantly less than those of Group B (14.2 dB vs 16.5 dB, P =.00005). However, there was no statistical difference between Group B and controls (16.5 dB vs 16.7 dB, P =.63). Conclusion: Sickle cell patients with focal macular thinning present on SD-OCT have significantly decreased retinal sensitivities compared to those without focal thinning or normal controls based on mean microperimetry sensitivities, despite similar age and visual acuity.

The literature indicated that varieties of medicinal plants are used regularly for the management of SCD related complications, such as sickling, infections, pain crisis, etc. Although, Bone marrow transplant, the only curative therapy and genetic counselling, have shown promising results for effective management of SCD, now a days people are using alternative pharmacological therapies for SCD management.","['alpha tocopherol', '  antioxidant', '  ascorbic acid', '  Bacopa monnieri extract', '  beta carotene', '  garlic extract', '  hemoglobin F', '  hydroxyurea', '  ionophore', '  nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent', '  Ocimum sanctum extract', '  opiate', '  Panax quniquefolium extract', '  penicillin G', '  plant extract', '  Pneumococcus vaccine', '  unclassified drug', '  acute chest syndrome', '  antimicrobial activity', '  antioxidant activity', '  anxiety disorder', '  arterial gas', '  arterial oxygen saturation', '  Bacopa monnieri', '  bone marrow transplantation', '  cognitive therapy', '  degranulation', '  depression', '  disease association', '  Doppler echography', '  drug efficacy', '  erythrocyte', '  erythrocyte count', '  garlic', '  gene replacement therapy', '  genetic counseling', '  growth', '  hand foot syndrome', '  hematocrit', '  herbal medicine', '  homozygosity', '  human', '  iron deficiency anemia', '  kidney disease', '  leg ulcer', '  mast cell', '  mean corpuscular volume', '  medicinal plant', '  mixed anxiety and depression', '  morbidity', '  mortality', '  nutritional status', '  pain', '  pneumococcal infection', '  prevalence', '  priapism', '  quality of life', '  reticulocyte count', '  retinopathy', '  review', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sorghum', '  spleen', '  splenectomy', '  stroke', '  systematic review (topic)', '  tidal volume']",1.0,Oriental Scientific Publishing Company,English,Review,['India'],[],['India'],2004 - 2013,1
388,Clinical complications in severe pediatric sickle cell disease and the impact of hydroxyurea,2011,Pediatric Blood and Cancer,"Background: More evidence of the safety and effectiveness of hydroxyurea (HU) in community-based cohorts of pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are needed. The association of HU with organ-specific clinical complications and adverse events is examined herein. Methods: Medicaid medical and pharmacy claims for the calendar years January 1996 through December 2006 were used to identify a cohort of children and adolescent patients (ages 17 and under) with a diagnosis of SCD (homozygous) who were treated with HU and developed disparate complications or adverse side effects. Of the 2,194 pediatric SCD patients identified, 175 (8%) were treated with HU. Incidence density matching (1 case: 2 controls) was used to select the control group on age, gender, ethnicity, time in the Medicaid data set, and baseline severity resulting in a total study cohort of 523 cases. Results: Organ-specific complications were more likely in the HU-treated group compared to non-HU-treated group: cardiovascular complications (odds ratio [OR] = 3.15; confidence interval [CI] = 1.97-5.03); hepatic complications (OR 5.41; CI = 3.54-8.27); renal complications (OR 5.09; CI 3.37-7.67); and pulmonary complications (OR 4.07; CI 1.88-8.79). Many of these conditions began developing before HU was prescribed. Developing three or more complications was also more likely in the HU group (27.4% vs. 7.0%, P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Extending previous findings to routine practice settings, HU is being administered to the most severely ill children with SCD, many of whom had already started to develop organ-specific complications, but it is not associated with development of serious adverse events. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","['hydroxyurea', '  penicillin G', '  acute chest syndrome', '  adolescent', '  article', '  bone necrosis', '  cardiovascular disease', '  child', '  childhood disease', '  cholecystitis', '  controlled study', '  drug eruption', '  ethnicity', '  female', '  gallstone', '  gender', '  hematuria', '  human', '  hyperbilirubinemia', '  hypersplenism', '  kidney failure', '  leg ulcer', '  leukemia', '  liver disease', '  lung complication', '  lung embolism', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  medicaid', '  neutropenia', '  pneumonia', '  polyuria', '  priapism', '  priority journal', '  proteinuria', '  pulmonary hypertension', '  retinopathy', '  seizure', '  sickle cell anemia', '  side effect', '  Streptococcus pneumonia', '  stroke', '  thrombocytopenia', '  transient ischemic attack', '  weight gain', '  Adolescent', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Antisickling Agents', '  Cardiovascular Diseases', '  Child', '  Child', ' Preschool', '  Data Collection', '  Female', '  Homozygote', '  Humans', '  Hydroxyurea', '  Infant', '  Infant', ' Newborn', '  Kidney Diseases', '  Liver Diseases', '  Lung Diseases', '  Male', '  Medicaid', '  United States']",20.0,,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2004 - 2013,1

Neovascular sea fans arise at the interface of perfused and nonperfused portions of the retina. Although some lesions undergo spontaneous autoinfarction, most show progressive growth, resulting in vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment. The emergence of neovascolarization is stimulated by the production of vascular growth factors and immunoreactivity for these factors is greater within neovascularization than in adjacent retina and in non perfused peripheral retina. All these lesions can be observed directly with an ophthalmoscope and indirectly with fluorescein angiography. The differential diagnosis of the neovascularization with other ischemic and inflammatory diseases is necessary. The usual goal of management is the early treatment of stage III lesions with laser photocoagulation and cryotherapy; pars plana vitrectomy or scleral buckling are avoided unless it is absolutely necessary. © Capsula Eburnea, 2010.",,0.0,,Italian,Review,['Italy'],[],['Italy'],2004 - 2013,1
391,Immunohistochemical localization of low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 and α2-Macroglobulin in retinal and choroidal tissue of proliferative retinopathies,2010,Experimental Eye Research,"The immunolocalization of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and its ligand α 2-Macroglobulin (α2M) was examined in tissues from human donor eyes of normal, diabetic and sickle cell disease subjects. Streptavidin alkaline phosphatase immunohistochemistry was performed with a mouse anti-human LRP1 and rabbit anti-human α2M antibodies. Retinal and choroidal blood vessels were labeled with mouse anti-human CD34 antibody in adjacent tissue sections. Mean scores for immunostaining from the pathological and control eyes were statistically compared.LRP1 immunoreactivity was very weak to negative in the neural retina of normal subjects except in scattered astrocytes. LRP1 expression in diabetic eyes was detected in the internal limiting membrane (ILM), astrocytes, inner photoreceptor matrix, choriocapillaris and choroidal stroma. The ligand α2M, however, was limited mainly to blood vessel walls, some areas of the inner nuclear layer (INL), photoreceptors, RPE-Bruch's membrane-choriocapillaris complex, intercapillary septa, and choroidal stroma. In sickle cell eyes, avascular and vascular retina as well as choroidal neovascularization (CNV) were analyzed. In avascular areas, LRP1 immunoreactivity was in innermost retina (presumably ILM, astrocytes, and Muller cells) and INL as well as RPE-Bruch's membrane-choriocapillaris complex and choroidal stroma α2M was very weak in avascular peripheral retina compared to vascularized areas and limited to stroma in choroid. In contrast, in areas with CNV, LRP1 immunoreactivity was significantly decreased in overlying retina and in RPE-Bruch's membrane and choroidal stroma compared to the controls, while α2M was elevated in RPE-Bruch's membrane near CNV compared to normal areas in sickle cell choroid. The mean scores revealed that LRP1 and α2M in neural retina were significantly elevated in astrocytes and ILM in diabetic eyes (p ≤ 0.05), whereas in sickle cell eyes scores were elevated in ILM and INL (p ≤ 0.05). In addition, α2M immunoreactivity was in photoreceptors in both ischemic retinopathies. In choroid, the patterns of LRP1 and α2M expression were different and not coincident.This is the first demonstration of the presence of LRP1 and α2M in human proliferative retinopathies. Elevated LRP1 expression in sickle cell neural retina and diabetic inner retina and choroid suggests that LRP1 plays an important role in ischemic neovascular diseases. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","['alkaline phosphatase', '  alpha 2 macroglobulin', '  low density lipoprotein receptor related protein', '  streptavidin', '  adult', '  aged', '  article', '  astrocyte', '  blood vessel wall', '  Bruch membrane', '  choroid capillary layer', '  choroid vascularization', '  clinical article', '  controlled study', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  female', '  human', '  human tissue', '  immunohistochemistry', '  immunolocalization', '  immunoreactivity', '  male', '  Mueller cell', '  photoreceptor', '  priority journal', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  protein expression', '  protein localization', '  retina bipolar ganglion cell', '  retina blood vessel', '  retina nerve cell', '  scoring system', '  sickle cell', '  subretinal neovascularization', '  Adult', '  Aged', '  Aged', ' 80 and over', '  alpha-Macroglobulins', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Choroid', '  Diabetic Retinopathy', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Immunoenzyme Techniques', '  LDL-Receptor Related Protein 1', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Retina', '  Retinal Neovascularization', '  Retinal Vessels']",22.0,,English,Article,"['Argentina', ' United States']","[National Institutes of Health, NIH, National Eye Institute, P30EY001765, R01EY009357, RPB, ACC, UNC, FFB, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas, Fondo, BID, OC-AR PICT N, Universidad de Buenos Aires, SECYT, Centro de Investigaciones Energéticas, Medioambientales y Tecnológicas]",['United States'],2004 - 2013,2
392,Pain rate and social circumstances rather than cumulative organ damage determine the quality of life in adults with sickle cell disease,2010,American Journal of Hematology,"Due to the significant morbidity associated with sickle cell disease (SCD), sickle cell patients have a reduced quality of life (QoL). Even though pain is considered an important determinant of QoL in sickle cell patients, factors such as organ damage and socioeconomic circumstances may also be important. Therefore, we determined the contribution of chronic organ damage and sickle cell-related complications to QoL and also analyzed the effect of vaso-occlusive crises and socioeconomic circumstances on QoL. Consecutive adult sickle cell patients were included. QoL was represented in a physical component scale (PCS) and a mental component scale (MCS) and assessed with SF-36 forms. Higher pain rates were related to lower QoL scores. Both occupation and the level of education were significantly related to PCS while no relation with MCS or pain rate was found. Thirty-five percent of the patients were unemployed when compared with 6% of the general population and 16% of immigrants without SCD. Neither genotype nor the presence of chronic organ damage were significantly related to QoL. In conclusion, a reduced QoL was mainly determined by pain rate, occupation, and educational level. Chronic organ damage, although a major factor determining life expectancy in SCD, was not a determinant of QoL.","['acute chest syndrome', '  article', '  bone necrosis', '  educational status', '  female', '  genotype', '  human', '  immigrant', '  iron overload', '  kidney failure', '  leg ulcer', '  male', '  mental health', '  microalbuminuria', '  morbidity', '  occupation', '  pain', '  priapism', '  priority journal', '  pulmonary hypertension', '  quality of life', '  retinopathy', '  Short Form 36', '  sickle cell anemia', '  socioeconomics', '  stroke', '  adult', '  letter', '  pain', '  pathology', '  psychological aspect', '  quality of life', '  sickle cell anemia', '  social environment', '  socioeconomics', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Pain', '  Quality of Life', '  Social Environment', '  Socioeconomic Factors', '  Young Adult']",25.0,,English,Article,"['Curaçao', ' Netherlands']",[],['Netherlands'],2004 - 2013,2

The objective of this study was to determine whether individuals with diabetes mellitus and SCT have higher rates of microvascular complications relative to those without SCT. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: This was a retrospective study comparing albuminuria, estimated GFR (eGFR), and microvascular complications in AA with diabetes on the basis of presence of SCT. The study included 821 outpatients who underwent hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing, and presence of SCT was determined using the HbA1c assay. Medical record review and telephone interviews were performed for AA participants. Results: Data were obtained on 376 AA patients (110 with SCT, 245 with neither SCT nor hemoglobin C trait, and 21 with hemoglobin C trait) and 445 European Americans. The mean eGFR and urinary protein excretion were similar between the three AA subgroups. Analysis revealed that 36.3% of AA nontrait and 22.7% of AA SCT participants had retinopathy, peripheral vascular disease, or end-stage kidney disease (P = 0.01). After adjustment for diabetes duration, age, insulin use, and gender, differences in the prevalence of microvascular complications were not observed. Conclusions: SCT does not increase the risk of microvascular complications in AA with diabetes mellitus.

395,Novel permeability characteristics of red blood cells from sickle cell patients heterozygous for HbS and HbC (HbSC genotype),2010,"Blood Cells, Molecules, and Diseases","Individuals heterozygous for HbS and HbC (HbSC) represent about 1/3rd of sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. Whilst HbSC disease is generally milder, there is considerable overlap in symptoms with HbSS disease. HbSC patients, as well as HbSS ones, present with the chronic anaemia and panoply of acute vaso-occlusive complications that characterize SCD. However, there are important clinical and haematological differences. Certain complications occur with greater frequency in HbSC patients (like proliferative retinopathy and osteonecrosis) whilst intravascular haemolysis is reduced. Patients with HbSC disease can be considered as a discrete subset of SCD cases. Although much work has been carried out on understanding the pathogenesis of SCD in HbSS homozygotes, including the contribution of altered red blood cell permeability, relatively little pertains directly to HbSC individuals. Results reported in the literature suggest that HbSC cells, and particularly certain subpopulations, present with similar permeability to HbSS cells but there are also important differences - these have not been well characterized. We hypothesise that their unique cell transport properties accounts for the different pattern of disease in HbSC patients and represents a potential chemotherapeutic target not shared in red blood cells from HbSS patients. The distinct pattern of clinical haematology in HbSC disease is emphasised here. We analyse some of the electrophysiological properties of single red blood cells from HbSC patients, comparing them with those from HbSS patients and normal HbAA individuals. We also use the isosmotic haemolysis technique to investigate the behaviour of total red blood cell populations. Whilst both HbSS and HbSC cells show increased monovalent and divalent (Ca2+) cation conductance further elevated upon deoxygenation, the distribution of current magnitudes differs, and outward rectification is greatest for HbSC cells. In addition, although Gd3+ largely abolishes the cation conductance of both HbSS and HbSC cells, only in HbSS ones are currents inhibited by the aminoglycosides like streptomycin. This distinction is retained in isosmotic lysis experiments where both HbSS and HbSC cells undergo haemolysis in sucrose solutions but streptomycin significantly inhibits lysis only in HbSS cells. These findings emphasise similarities but also differences in the permeability properties of HbSS and HbSC cells, which may be important in pathogenesis. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","['calcium ion', '  divalent cation', '  hemoglobin A', '  hemoglobin C', '  hemoglobin S', '  monovalent cation', '  article', '  cell function', '  cell membrane permeability', '  cell population', '  cell transport', '  child', '  controlled study', '  deoxygenation', '  electrophysiology', '  genotype', '  hemolysis', '  human', '  human cell', '  ion conductance', '  patch clamp', '  pathogenesis', '  priority journal', '  school child', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Calcium', '  Cations', '  Cell Membrane Permeability', '  Child', '  Electrophysiological Phenomena', '  Erythrocytes', '  Hemoglobin C', '  Hemoglobin SC Disease', '  Hemoglobin', ' Sickle', '  Hemolysis', '  Heterozygote', '  Humans', '  Patch-Clamp Techniques']",14.0,,English,Article,"['Denmark', ' United Kingdom']",[Medical Research Council],['United Kingdom'],2004 - 2013,2

Methods: Case report. Results: A 15 year-old boy with a history of hypertensive uveitis of two months duration was reffered to our institution. He was treated with topical prednisolone acetate, beta-blockers and acetazolamide.The visual acuity was 20/200 RE and 20/25 LE. Anterior inflammation included fine inferior keratic precipitates with 2+ cells RE and 1+ cells LE. Vitreous haze was 2+ preventing clear vieuw of subretinal infiltrates scattered around the posterior pole and midperipheral retina, some of them having a salmon patch appearence. Fluorescein angiograms revealed multiple preretinal haemorrahge and some areas of retinal ischemia. Fundus examination of the left eye was normal. A diagnosis of panuveitis was done and a sickle cell retinopathy was suspected. Systemic workup showed an hemoglobin at 8,2 mg/dl and sickle cells on direct examination. Two days later he developped sudden loss of vision in the right eye. Funduscopy an angiogram revealed macular infarction with occlusion of the retinal arterioles surrounding the foveal avascular zone. The clinical picture was not improved by erythrocyte transfusion. Intraocular pressure raised again after few days, and was finally controlled by anterior chamber paracentesis. The patient was later found to be homozygous for HbS.

400,Ocular manifestations of sickle cell disease,2010,Annals of Tropical Paediatrics,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic disease worldwide. The increase in life expectancy of SCD patients in recent years has led to the emergence of more complications of the disease, e.g. ocular, which in the past were uncommon. This review describes current knowledge of the ocular manifestations of patients with SCD. SCD can affect virtually every vascular bed in the eye and can cause blindness in the advanced stages. The most significant ocular changes are those which occur in the fundus, which can be grouped into proliferative sickle retinopathy, and non-proliferative retinal changes based on the presence of vascular proliferation. This distinction is important because the formation of new vessels is the single most important precursor of potentially blinding complications. Although various systemic complications of SCD are known to be more common in patients with the Hb SS genotype, visual impairment secondary to proliferative sickle retinopathy is more common in patients with the Hb SC genotype. There is also an increase with age in the incidence and prevalence rates of all ocular complications of SCD. It is therefore recommended that all patients with SCD undergo periodic ophthalmological screening from the age of 10 years. © 2010 The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.","['blindness', '  clinical feature', '  cryotherapy', '  diathermy', '  disease classification', '  disease course', '  disease predisposition', '  disease severity', '  early diagnosis', '  eye disease', '  genotype', '  geographic distribution', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  human', '  incidence', '  laser coagulation', '  pathophysiology', '  prognosis', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  retina detachment', '  retina neovascularization', '  review', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell trait', '  visual impairment', '  vitreous hemorrhage', '  Age Factors', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Child', '  Eye Diseases', '  Humans', '  Incidence', '  Prevalence', '  Retina', '  Vision', ' Ocular']",34.0,,English,Review,"['Brazil', ' United Kingdom']",[],['Brazil'],2004 - 2013,2

Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study in a group of 146 (292 eyes) sickle cell disease patients (90 HBSS and 56 HBSC). Ophthalmologic examination including indirect binocular ophthalmoscopy was performed. Examination was completed by fluorescein angiography to detect retinal lesions. Results: The most frequent ocular lesions identified were ""vascular tortuosity"" and ""black sunburst"". Proliferative retinopathy was found in 22 (12.2%) eyes of HBSS patients and 25 (22.3%) eyes of HBSC patients (OR=2.06; CI95%: 1.5-4.06, p=0.022); Its frequency was higher among HBSS patients aged 20-39 years, while in HBSC patients, it peaked after 40 years (35.7% and 42.8%) and dropped sharply afterwards. Conclusion: Proliferative retinopathy was described as early as 10 years of age in both patients groups.

408,Elevated endothelial progenitor cells during painful sickle cell crisis,2009,Experimental Hematology,"Objective: Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) counts were determined in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) to elucidate their role in SCD-related ischemia-induced angiogenesis and reendothelialization. Materials and Methods: Circulating EPC counts (KDR+/CD34+/Cd45dim cells) and their relation to serum levels of EPC mobilizing growth factors erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and interleukin-8 were investigated in SCD patients during asymptomatic state (n = 66) and painful crisis (n = 36) and compared to healthy controls (n = 13). Results: EPC counts were comparable between controls (0; range, 0-1.1 cells/mL) and patients (0; range, 0-0 cells/mL) in asymptomatic state, but were significantly higher during painful crisis (41.7; range, 0-186 cells/mL; p &lt; 0.05). Also in a paired analysis of 12 patients who were included both during asymptomatic state and painful crisis, EPC counts increased significantly during painful crisis (from 0 [range, 0-0] to 26 [range, 0-149 cell/mL; p &lt; 0.05). EPC counts were not related to any of the measured growth factors. Conclusion: The higher EPC counts during painful crisis might indicate a role for EPC mobilization in reendothelialization.

410,Circulating endothelial cells: A potential parameter of organ damage in sickle cell anemia?,2009,"Blood Cells, Molecules, and Diseases","Objective laboratory tools are needed to monitor developing organ damage in sickle cell disease (SCD). Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) are indicative of vascular injury. We determined whether elevated CEC can be detected in asymptomatic SCD with the CellSearch system and whether the CEC count is related to clinical and blood-based biomarkers of disease severity. Fifteen consecutive clinically asymptomatic HbSS patients and 15 matched HbAA controls were analyzed for CEC counts, laboratory parameters of disease severity (Hb, leukocyte counts, HbF%), plasma levels of markers for endothelial activation (sVCAM-1, VWF:Ag) and of endogenous inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (asymmetrical dimethylarginine [ADMA]). CEC counts were significantly higher in patients (12 cells/mL, IQR 8-29) as compared to controls (4 cells/mL, 3-10) (P = 0.007). CEC counts were significantly higher in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PHT) (P = 0.015), and increased with increasing number of affected organs (0-4 involved organs, P = 0.002). No significant correlations between CEC and any other laboratory parameter were detected. In conclusion, CECs could prove to be an important new tool for assessing developing vasculopathy and organ damage in SCD. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Patients and method: From July to October 2000, 26 patients with sickle cell disease (SS, SC, and thalassemia) were recruited, most followed in the pediatric department. After an ophthalmologic clinical examination, fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography(ICG) were performed. Results: The average age was 14.3 years (range, 9-24 years). There were 17 SS forms (65.4%), five SC forms (19.2%), and four beta-thalassemia forms (15.4%). The ICG was well tolerated. In 24 cases (92.3%), we observed rarefaction of the choriocapillaris out of the posterior pole with no difference depending on the genotype. We noted neither hypo- nor hyperfluorescence of the choroid at the retinal ischemic areas, the black spots were clearly delimited, and photocoagulation scars appeared larger than in fluorescein angiography. Discussion: Our ICG study did not show anomalies of the choroidal circulation but rarefaction of the choriocapillaris was observed in most patients, a striking finding. This lower visibility or nonperfusion could be explained by anatomical modifications or by a centripetal reduction in the density of the choriocapillaris concomitant to the microvascular occlusive phenomena in the ischemic retina. Conclusion: This study is the first to use ICG in sickle cell retinopathy. The rarefaction of the choriocapillaris observed may be related to the systemic disease. However, it must be compared with the choriocapillaris of normal subjects at the same age. © 2009.","['coloring agent', '  diagnostic agent', '  indocyanine green', '  adolescent', '  adult', '  angiography', '  article', '  child', '  clinical trial', '  female', '  human', '  male', '  methodology', '  pilot study', '  prospective study', '  radiography', '  retina artery', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Adolescent', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Angiography', '  Child', '  Coloring Agents', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Indocyanine Green', '  Male', '  Pilot Projects', '  Prospective Studies', '  Retinal Artery', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Young Adult']",6.0,,French,Article,"['Burkina Faso', ' France']",[],['Burkina Faso'],2004 - 2013,2
412,Complications Associated with Sickle Cell Trait: A Brief Narrative Review,2009,American Journal of Medicine,"Sickle cell trait occurs in approximately 300 million people worldwide, with the highest prevalence of approximately 30% to 40% in sub-Saharan Africa. Long considered a benign carrier state with relative protection against severe malaria, sickle cell trait occasionally can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Sickle cell trait is exclusively associated with rare but often fatal renal medullary cancer. Current cumulative evidence is convincing for associations with hematuria, renal papillary necrosis, hyposthenuria, splenic infarction, exertional rhabdomyolysis, and exercise-related sudden death. Sickle cell trait is probably associated with complicated hyphema, venous thromboembolic events, fetal loss, neonatal deaths, and preeclampsia, and possibly associated with acute chest syndrome, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and anemia in pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence to suggest an independent association with retinopathy, cholelithiasis, priapism, leg ulcers, liver necrosis, avascular necrosis of the femoral head, and stroke. Despite these associations, the average life span of individuals with sickle cell trait is similar to that of the general population. Nonetheless, given the large number of people with sickle cell trait, it is important that physicians be aware of these associations. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

415,Systemic effects of intra-articular corticosteroids,2009,Clinical Rheumatology,"The objective of this study was to review all the published articles in the English literature about the systemic effects of intra-articular corticosteroid injection (IACI) in humans. Reports were searched through Pubmed using the terms intraarticular or intra-articular and steroids, corticosteroids, or glucocorticosteroids up and including the year 2007. Reports were also located through references of articles. Only objective findings outside the injected joint were included. The overwhelming majority of the studies was done at the knee joint and in rheumatoid arthritis/juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients. Many of the studies were done on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Serum cortisol decreased within hours with a nadir after usually 24-48 h following the IACI. Recovery to baseline takes 1-4 weeks and sometimes longer depending on the type and dose of IACI and on the number of injected joints. Serum cortisol levels were blunted following adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation in a small proportion of patients following methylprednisolone acetate injection and more common following other preparations. IACI resulted in a transient increase in blood glucose levels over few days in controlled diabetic patients with knee osteoarthritis. Peak levels are around 300 mg%. IACIs are associated with reduction in inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate that start few days following the IACI and could last for months. The effect on inflammatory cytokines is immediate with significant decrease within hours. IACI may induce remission also in patients with oligo-/polyarthritis and/or in patients with extra-articular manifestations.

416,Sickle cell disease in the post genomic era: A monogenic disease with a polygenic phenotype,2009,Genomics Insights,"More than half a century after the discovery of the molecular basis of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), the causes of the phenotypic heterogeneity of the disease remain unclear. This heterogeneity manifests with different clinical outcomes such as stroke, vaso-occlusive episodes, acute chest syndrome, avascular necrosis, leg ulcers, priapism and retinopathy. These outcomes cannot be explained by the single mutation in the beta-globin gene alone but may be attributed to genetic modifiers and environmental effects. Recent advances in the post human genome sequence era have opened the door for the identification of novel genetic modifiers in SCD. Studies are showing that phenotypes of SCD seem to be modulated by polymorphisms in genes that are involved in inflammation, cell-cell interaction and modulators of oxidant injury and nitric oxide biology. The discovery of genes implicated in different phenotypes will help understanding of the physiopathology of the disease and aid in establishing targeted cures. However, caution is needed in asserting that genetic modifiers are the cause of all SCD phenotypes, because there are other factors such as genetic background of the population, environmental components, socio-economics and psychology that can play significant roles in the clinical heterogeneity.",,77.0,Libertas Academica Ltd.,English,Review,['United States'],[],['United States'],2004 - 2013,1

Patients and method.- This retrospective study investigated 173 patients in an ambulatory setting from August 2000 to July 2006. The study included 98 women and 75 men, aged 15-62 years, with a mean age of 26.7 years. Results.- Only 89 patients (71 SC and 18 SS) were seen in ophthalmology, 44 (49%) had sickle cell retinopathy with 26 (29%) cases nonproliferative and 18 cases proliferative (20%). Among the 71 SC patients, 35 (50%) had sickle cell retinopathy, with 40% the proliferative form. Of the 18 SS patients, nine had a retinopathy (50%), with four cases proliferative. Discussion.- Retinopathy is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease, which can lead to blindness, and its management better accessibility to the ophthalmologic examination and preventive treatment by laser photo coagulation. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

419,Guidelines for management of adult sickle cell disease [Recommandations pratiques de prise en charge de la drépanocytose de l'adulte],2009,Revue de Medecine Interne,"Sickle cell disease is a systemic disease that can potentially involve all organs. As the prevalence of patients with sickle cell disease increases gradually in France, every physician can be potentially involved in the care of these patients. Complications of sickle cell disease can be acute or chronic. Pain is the main symptom and should be treated quickly and aggressively. Acute chest syndrome is the leading cause of acute death and must be prevented, detected, and treated without delay. Chronic complications are one of the main concerns in adults and should be identified as early as possible in order to prevent sequels. Many organs can be involved, including the bones, kidneys, eyes, lungs... The indications for a specific treatment (blood transfusion or hydroxyurea) should be discussed. Health care should be carefully organized to allow both a regular follow-up near the living place and access to specialized departments.

The mean follow-up was 15.5 months (range: 3-60). Two patients were SS, and the remainders were doubly heterozygous (SC). In all, 10 were observed without surgery three with vitreous haemorrhage, four tractional retinal detachments (TRD), and three rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (RRD). Two patients demonstrated spontaneous flattening of the retina one RRD and one TRD. Eighteen eyes had pars plana vitrectomies (PPVs) seven with vitreous haemorrhage, three RRD, three TRD, three ERM (one bilateral), and two macular holes. In all, 15 patients (83%) had improved vision postoperatively. The mean logMar preoperative visual acuity was 1.07 (Snellen equivalent 6/70), SD 0.62 was significantly improved postoperatively (mean 0.42 (6/15), SD 0.48, P0.001).ConclusionsSickle retinopathy occasionally presents with vitreoretinal complications.

421,Characteristics and Outcome of Connective Tissue Diseases in Patients with Sickle-Cell Disease: Report of 30 Cases,2008,Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism,"Objectives: To analyze the main characteristics of adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) and concurrent connective tissue disease (CTD). Methods: A retrospective investigational study was performed. CTD was diagnosed according to standard international criteria. Severity of SCD was assessed by a clinical severity score. Results: Thirty patients, 23 women (76%) and 7 men, with hemoglobin S/S (n = 25) or S/C (n = 5) SCD were included. The subtypes of CTD were rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n = 15), definite systemic lupus erythematosus or ""incomplete lupus"" requiring treatment (n = 13), primary Sjögren's syndrome with central nervous system involvement (n = 1), and systemic sclerosis (n = 1). Twenty-five of the 30 patients (83%) received steroid treatment, and 15 (50%) received at least 1 immunosuppressive agent (methotrexate in 14 cases) to control CTD. Four RA patients were given antitumor necrosis factor (TNF)α and 1 was treated with rituximab without SCD exacerbation. After a median follow-up of 4.5 years [range: 6 months to 30 years] from CTD diagnosis, 11 of the 25 (44%) patients receiving steroids had at least 1 episode of severe infection (mostly due to Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli). SCD exacerbated in 13 of the 30 (43%) patients after CTD onset; 12 of these patients were receiving prednisone and/or methotrexate. Six patients (20%) had died from sepsis (n = 2), stroke (n = 2), or acute chest syndrome (n = 2). Conclusions: CTD-related clinical manifestations and outcome were not particularly severe in patients with SCD. However, those with active CTD and undergoing steroid ± methotrexate treatment had more serious SCD-related manifestations, a higher rate of severe infections, and an overall patient mortality rate of 20%. Thus, the management of patients with CTD and underlying SCD should consider the risk/benefit ratio of each treatment and steroid-sparing strategies should be implemented. © 2008.","['adalimumab', '  autoantibody', '  azathioprine', '  bosentan', '  corticosteroid', '  cyclophosphamide', '  cyclosporin', '  dapsone', '  etanercept', '  gold', '  hemoglobin C', '  hemoglobin S', '  hydroxychloroquine', '  hydroxyurea', '  infliximab', '  isoniazid', '  leflunomide', '  methotrexate', '  methylprednisolone', '  penicillamine', '  prednisolone', '  prednisone', '  recombinant interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent', '  rifampicin', '  rituximab', '  salazosulfapyridine', '  triamcinolone hexacetonide', '  tumor necrosis factor alpha antibody', '  warfarin', '  acute chest syndrome', '  adult', '  article', '  avascular necrosis', '  blood transfusion', '  blood vessel occlusion', '  bone radiography', '  brain hemorrhage', '  cause of death', '  central nervous system disease', '  cerebrovascular accident', '  clinical article', '  clinical feature', '  connective tissue disease', '  disease exacerbation', '  disease severity', '  drug dose reduction', '  drug fatality', '  drug megadose', '  drug substitution', '  drug withdrawal', '  Enterobacter infection', '  Escherichia coli', '  female', '  follow up', '  gastrointestinal symptom', '  human', '  immunosuppressive treatment', '  infection', '  liver toxicity', '  low drug dose', '  male', '  mortality', '  nephrotic syndrome', '  priority journal', '  pulmonary hypertension', '  retinopathy', '  rheumatoid arthritis', '  sepsis', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Sjoegren syndrome', '  skin manifestation', '  Staphylococcus aureus', '  Staphylococcus infection', '  steroid therapy', '  stroke', '  systemic lupus erythematosus', '  systemic sclerosis', '  tuberculosis', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Antisickling Agents', '  Arthritis', ' Rheumatoid', '  Blood Transfusion', '  Drug Therapy', ' Combination', '  Female', '  France', '  Glucocorticoids', '  Humans', '  Hydroxyurea', '  Immunosuppressive Agents', '  Lupus Erythematosus', ' Systemic', '  Male', '  Methotrexate', '  Retrospective Studies', '  Risk Assessment', '  Severity of Illness Index', '  Survival Rate', '  Treatment Outcome']",28.0,,English,Article,"['France', ' Martinique']",[],['France'],2004 - 2013,2
422,Genetics of ischemic stroke,2008,Neurosciences,"Stroke is the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability worldwide. Most cases of ischemic stroke are attributable to hypertension and other risk factors, but in over 20% of cases, the cause is unknown. Recent research has implicated some novel genes in the etiology of ischemic stroke, including genes for soluble epoxide hydrolase (sHE), 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) and phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D). Moreover, thrombophilic states such as prothrombin G20210A mutation and factor V Leiden are now known to cause arterial stroke as well as venous thrombosis. Meanwhile, the recent availability of enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry disease and the proven benefits of regular blood transfusion in certain patients with sickle cell disease have greatly altered the outlook of these devastating inherited disorders. Thus, our understanding of the role of genetic factors in stroke raises the prospects for accurate assessment of future stroke risk among susceptible individuals, in whom early preventive measures may be life-saving. Further research into the genetics of stroke will clearly compliment ongoing national and international efforts to reduce the global burden of stroke.","['agalsidase beta', '  arachidonate 5 lipoxygenase activating protein', '  atrial natriuretic factor', '  blood clotting factor 5 Leiden', '  dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase', '  epoxide hydrolase', '  leukotriene', '  phosphodiesterase IV', '  prothrombin', '  blood transfusion', '  CADASIL', '  cerebrovascular accident', '  disease association', '  enzyme replacement', '  Fabry disease', '  gene mutation', '  genetic analysis', '  genetic polymorphism', '  human', '  hyperhomocysteinemia', '  kidney disease', '  protein C deficiency', '  protein S deficiency', '  retinopathy', '  review', '  risk factor', '  sickle cell anemia', '  skin biopsy', '  vascular disease']",3.0,,English,Review,['Saudi Arabia'],[],['Saudi Arabia'],2004 - 2013,1

Under ordinary circumstances, those with sickle cell trait do not develop sickling or anemia and thus do not present with clinical signs or symptoms. However, retinopathy may occur in those individuals with sickle cell trait when there are other precipitating factors present. Under conditions that contribute to hypoxia, patients who have sickle cell trait may develop sickle cell retinopathy and other ocular complications. Case Reports: Two cases in which the individual had what appeared to be sea fan neovascularization are presented. Both were found to have sickle cell trait. Both had other systemic vascular diseases that were believed to have contributed to the development of the sea fan neovascularization. Conclusions: Sea fan neovascularization can occur in patients without sickle cell anemia. In such cases, an investigation for hemoglobinopathies in conjunction with other systemic conditions which may be contributing to hypoxia must be conducted. Those patients who are known to have both sickle cell trait and other systemic vascular disease should undergo regular ophthalmic examination.",,0.0,,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2004 - 2013,1

425,Hyperbaric oxygen therapy and the eye,2008,Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine,"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a primary or adjunctive therapy for a variety of medical disorders including some involving the eye. This paper is the first comprehensive review of HBOT for ocular indications. The authors recommend the following as ocular indications for HBOT: decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism with visual signs or symptoms, central retinal artery occlusion, ocular and periocular gas gangrene, cerebro-rhino-orbital mucormycosis, periocular necrotizing fasciitis, carbon monoxide poisoning with visual sequelae, radiation optic neuropathy, radiation or mitomycin C-induced scleral necrosis, and periorbital reconstructive surgery. Other ocular disorders that may benefit from HBOT include selected cases of ischemic optic neuropathy, ischemic central retinal vein occlusion, branch retinal artery occlusion with central vision loss, ischemic branch retinal vein occlusion, cystoid macular edema associated with retinal venous occlusion, post-surgical inflammation, or intrinsic inflammatory disorders, periocular brown recluse spider envenomation, ocular quinine toxicity, Purtscher's retinopathy, radiation retinopathy, anterior segment ischemia, retinal detachment in sickle cell disease, refractory actinomycotic lacrimal canaliculus, pyoderma gangrenosum of the orbit and refractory pseudomonas keratitis. Visual function should be monitored as clinically indicated before, during, and after therapy when HBOT is undertaken to treat vision loss. Visual acuity alone is not an adequate measure of visual function to monitor the efficacy of HBOT in this setting. Ocular examinations should also include automated perimetry to evaluate the central 30 degrees of visual field at appropriate intervals. Interpretation of the literature on the efficacy of HBOT in treating ocular disorders is complicated by several factors: frequent failure to include visual field examination as an outcome measure, failure to adequately address the interval from symptom onset to initiation of HBOT, and lack of evidence for optimal treatment regimens for essentially all ocular indications. Because some ocular disorders require rapid administration of HBOT to restore vision, patients with acute vision loss should be considered emergent when they present. Visual acuity should be checked immediately, including vision with pinhole correction. If the patient meets the criteria for emergent HBOT outlined in the paper, normobaric oxygen should be started at the highest inspired oxygen fraction possible until arrangements can be made for HBOT.","['air embolism', '  carbon monoxide intoxication', '  decompression sickness', '  eye disease', '  gas gangrene', '  human', '  hyperbaric oxygen', '  mucormycosis', '  necrosis', '  necrotizing fasciitis', '  pathology', '  radiation injury', '  retina artery occlusion', '  retina vein occlusion', '  review', '  sclera', '  visual disorder', '  Carbon Monoxide Poisoning', '  Decompression Sickness', '  Embolism', ' Air', '  Eye Diseases', '  Fasciitis', ' Necrotizing', '  Gas Gangrene', '  Humans', '  Hyperbaric Oxygenation', '  Mucormycosis', '  Necrosis', '  Radiation Injuries', '  Retinal Artery Occlusion', '  Retinal Vein Occlusion', '  Sclera', '  Vision Disorders']",53.0,,English,Review,['United States'],[],['United States'],2004 - 2013,1

It is a public health problem in Tunisia. Aim : In this paper, we will study the outcome of 105 tunisians infants affected by this disease. Methods : It is a retrospective study over 8 years, enrolling 105 tunisian infants with sickle cell disease. Their main age is 10 years 7 months (19 months - 18 years). They are distributed into 58 boys and 47 girls. Sixty two of them are homozygotes S/S, and 43 are double heterozygotes (S/, thalassemics = 41 cases, S/O arab = 1 case, S/C = 1 case) Results : The main acute complications were vaso occlusive crises in 85 patients. They essentially reach the limbs. One hundred and twenty one events "" acute anaemia"" were observed. They are distributed into 107 events splenic sequestration (88.4%) and 14 events erythroblastopenia (11.6%). Eleven of our patients (10.4%) have presented 16 events ischemic cerebral vascular (strokes). Twenty events acute chest syndrome were observed in 15 patients (14.3%). Infectious complications were noted in 83 patients (79%). The priapism was observed in only 4 boys out of 58. The chronic degenerative complications were as follows : Femur head necrosis in 9 cases, degenerative retinopathy in one case and ulcer leg in one case. Hydroxyurea was reserved to 30 patients with a severe form of the disease. All of them improve the clinical outcome as attested by the number of days of hospitalisation / patient / year, which drops from 30 days to 3 days only (p< 0,001). We not deplore any death. Conclusion : By its complications, sickle cell disease is a potentielly serious disease. Hydroxyurea is an efficient treatment for the most severe forms.","['hydroxyurea', '  acute chest syndrome', '  adolescent', '  adult', '  anemia', '  cerebrovascular disease', '  child', '  clinical feature', '  disease association', '  erythroblastopenia', '  female', '  femur head necrosis', '  follow up', '  general condition improvement', '  heterozygote', '  homozygote', '  hospitalization', '  human', '  leg ulcer', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  outcome assessment', '  pediatric ward', '  retinopathy', '  retrospective study', '  review', '  school child', '  sickle cell anemia', '  stroke', '  Tunisia', '  vein occlusion']",0.0,,French,Review,['Tunisia'],[],['Tunisia'],2004 - 2013,1

Patients and methods: Patients with sickle cell disease aged more than 18 years old were consecutively referred for screening of sickle cell retinopathy in the ophthalmology department from December 2005 to March 2008. Complete ophthalmologic examination with dilated funduscopy was performed in each patient. Fluorescein angiography was performed in cases with ischemic retinopathy. Goldberg and Penman classifications were used to grade retinopathy severity. Results: Fifty-five patients (100 eyes) were included (26 S/S, 9 S/C, 12 S/β, 3 S/S with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin). Sickle cell retinopathy is more severe in patients with the S/C genotype than the S/S and S/β genotypes. Proliferative retinopathy is more common in S/C patients than S/S and S/β patients (S/C vs S/S, pCombining double low line0.001 ; S/C vs Sβ, pCombining double low line0.01). A qualitatively abnormal vascular border (type II) is also more frequent in S/C patients than S/S and S/β patients (S/C vs S/S, pCombining double low line0.001; S/C vs Sβ, pCombining double low line0.01). No proliferative retinopathy was found in patients with S/S and hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin syndrome. Conclusions: Screening is useful to detect sickle cell retinopathy, particularly in the adult population, to prevent complications from proliferative retinopathy. © 2008.

432,Acute splenic sequestration in an adult with hemoglobin S-C disease,2008,American Journal of Emergency Medicine,"Acute splenic sequestration crisis is a common, potentially life-threatening complication of sickle cell anemia in children that is uncommon in adults. We present the case of a 44-year-old gentleman with undiagnosed hemoglobin S-C disease who developed intense back pain, marked abdominal distension, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and multisystem organ failure that first presented as acute splenic sequestration crisis. The hemoglobinopathy SC is a disease caused by heterozygous-globin chain mutations with overlapping clinical features of sickle cell disease with changes in the frequency of these manifestations reflected by the combination of characteristics of hemoglobin C and hemoglobin S. In hemoglobin S-C disease, autosplenectomy is rare and splenomegaly usually persists until adulthood; vasoocclusive complications are seen less habitually and become evident at a later time compared with sickle cell disease. The diagnosis of hemoglobin S-C disease is essentially done by exclusion. Transfusion of red blood cells is the treatment of choice, but splenectomy is indicated if transfusion therapy fails. A review of the literature and key points for the emergency practitioner are included. Acute splenic sequestration crisis (ASSC) is the sudden impounding of red blood cells by the spleen, characterized by the rapid fall in hemoglobin concentration, rise in reticulocyte count, and splenomegaly [1,2]. Emergency practitioners are familiar with this clinical entity in children and adolescents. This potentially life-threatening condition requires prompt recognition and treatment. In the adult patient, ASSC is extremely rare. We recently had one such case. A 44-year-old African American man with a prior history of diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, and illicit drug use presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of nonexertional dyspnea and severe back pain for 12 hours before presentation. The patient reported malaise, fatigue, weakness that started 3 days before, chronic blurred vision, insomnia, and anxiety. He denied fever, recent travel, chest pain, or cough. The remainder of the review of systems was unremarkable. His heart rate was 101 bpm, respiratory rate was 31/min, temperature was 98.8°F, blood pressure was 148/62 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation on room air was 99%. The patient was awake, alert, and oriented to time, place, and person. He was motionless to avoid back pain. Jugular venous distension was 1 cm above the sternal angle. No cervical, inguinal, or axillary lymphadenopathy was detected. Normal S1 and S2 were noticed by auscultation. No S3 and S4 were identified. No murmurs, rubs, or gallop was present. Point of maximal impact was on the fifth intercostal space. Symmetric thoracic expansion and normal breath sounds with normal ventilatory effort were noticed. No crackles, wheezing, or rhonchi was detected by auscultation. No chest tenderness came up from palpation. No abnormalities were detected by chest percussion. Upon palpation, the abdomen was nontender, with moderate distension and normal bowel sounds. No visceral organomegaly or signs of portal hypertension were detected in examination. In the neurological examination, cranial nerves from II to XII were grossly intact. No sensory or motor defects were noticed. Strength was 4/5 in all 4 extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were normoactive. Normal flexor plantar response was obtained, and no meningismus was detected. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. Initial laboratory tests done in the ED revealed a white blood cell count of 11.2 × 109/L (with no abnormalities in differential count), hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, hematocrit of 26.3%, mean corpuscular volume of 76.7 Femtoliters (fL), mean corpuscular hemoglobin of 27.3 pg, and platelets of 144 × 109/L. The patient had a blood glucose level of 267 mg/dL, sodium level of 138 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L, chloride level of 109 mEq/L, CO2 content of 23 mEq/L, serum urea nitrogen level of 6 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, serum protein level of 7.2 g/dL, AST of 79 U/L, ALT 30 of U/L, alkaline phosphatase level of 475 U/L, total bilirubin level of 2.3 mg/dL, and direct bilirubin level of 0.8 mg/dL. Fibrinogen level was 342 mg/dL, D-dimer level was 15.90 mg/L, aPTT was 26.6 seconds, PT was 12.8 seconds, and INR was 1.2. Low-density lipoprotein level was 2752 IU/L, lipase level was 33 U/L, and amylase level was 37 U/L. Hepatitis A antibodies IgG and IgM, hepatitis B surface antigen antibody, hepatitis C antibody, and HIV antibody were nonreactive. Urinalysis revealed urine glucose level of 500 mg/dL; the remainder of the urinalysis was normal. Occult blood in stool test was negative. Sedimentation rate was 54 mm/h with a C-reactive protein level of 2.3 mg/dL. An electrocardiogram and a 2-view chest x-ray performed did not reveal any abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine was performed per emergency medicine service order that revealed a congenital L2-L3, L3-L4, and L4-L5 spinal stenosis. No other changes were noticed. Despite aggressive narcotic treatment of back pain, the pain continued to increase; therefore, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was ordered, revealing an enlarged spleen that measured 15.8 cm, but otherwise unremarkable. The abdominal CT scan was repeated 1 hour later as the back pain continued to increase, and the patient developed worsening distress and hypotension of 90/50 mm Hg. The new CT scan of the abdomen revealed an increasing splenomegaly (18.2 × 7.7 cm) compared with the previous one (Figs. 1 and 2). The patient's back pain remained intractable with concomitant previously mentioned increasing splenomegaly and hypotension. The patient was admitted for further treatment in the telemetry unit. Despite red blood cell transfusion therapy with 4 packed red blood cells, the patient's hemoglobin progressively dropped to a level of less than 4 mg/dL over the course of 3 hours, with evolving thrombocytopenia (&lt;50 × 109/L). The patient was immediately transferred to an intensive care unit. At the intensive care unit, the patient exhibited altered mental status and worsening gas exchange. Airway protection with intubation and mechanical ventilation were initiated. As the patient was rapidly deteriorating, an emergent splenectomy was performed, confirming the findings of the CT scan. Intraoperatively, the spleen was friable with specific infarction sites. Postoperatively, the patient developed multisystem organ failure with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. After extensive management and rehabilitation, the patient recovered every organ function and, 6 months later, has resumed his normal activities. The hemoglobinopathy SC, also known as sickle cell hemoglobin C disease, is caused by heterozygous-globin chain mutations that share overlapping clinical manifestations with sickle cell disease with changes in the frequency of these manifestations. In the mutant sickle hemoglobin (S), valine has been substituted for the glutamic acid normally at the sixth amino acid of the globin β chain; and in hemoglobin C, glutamic acid in the sixth position from the N terminal of the chain has been replaced by lysine [3]. In hemoglobin S-C disease, autosplenectomy is rare and splenomegaly usually persists until adulthood; vasoocclusive complications are seen less habitually and become evident at a later time compared with hemoglobin S (sickle cell disease). Hemolysis is less intense and anemia is consequently milder. Thus, the main complications of hemolysis (ie, aplastic episode and cholelithiasis) occur less frequently and with less severity. Proliferative sickle retinopathy is much more prevalent in hemoglobin S-C disease than in sickle cell anemia, and the mortality of acute chest syndrome may be increased [3]. The pathophysiologic mechanism of ASSC is dependent on the combined characteristics of hemoglobin C and hemoglobin S. Hemoglobin C is responsible for the increased potassium efflux stimulated by hypotonic conditions. Potassium efflux depends on chloride and N-ethylmaleidamide. Hypotonic conditions induce an active potassium-chloride cotransport that dehydrates hemoglobin S-C cells (increasing their density and decreasing their solubility) and consequently increasing hemoglobin S polymerization and losing red blood cells flexibility and decreasing their capacity to freely flow through capillaries [3]. The clinical features of ASSC in our patient were atypical compared with those reported by others [4]. Only 38% of the patients with ASSC reported in the literature had a variety of different nontypical onset that includes profound general weakness, left flank pain, nausea, vomiting, back pain, and shortness of breath [5-10]. No precise predisposing factor for ASSC was noted in the patient's history or examination. Physical activity concomitant with undocumented pulmonary disease may have contributed to prolonged hypoxia, which triggered the onset of ASSC. To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of ASSC in adults who presented with back pain; the other patient died on the second hospital day [8]. Although the posteromedial side of a normal spleen makes minimum contact with the left kidney, the enlarged spleen in this case made extensive contact with the left kidney, irritating the Gerota's fascia and consequently having a retroperitoneal irritation as the sources of the back pain. The concomitant presentation of acute splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and rapidly worsening anemia (when considered as part of a common syndrome) in a patient such as the one presented has several possible etiologies, including infection, malignancy, rheumatoid arthritis, and others (as depicted in Table 1).","['globin', '  hemoglobin C', '  hemoglobin S', '  abdominal distension', '  adult', '  article', '  backache', '  case report', '  clinical feature', '  comorbidity', '  computer assisted tomography', '  drug use', '  electrocardiogram', '  erythrocyte transfusion', '  fatigue', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  human', '  hypotension', '  laboratory test', '  malaise', '  male', '  multiple organ failure', '  mutation', '  priority journal', '  sickle cell', '  spleen disease', '  spleen sequestration', '  splenectomy', '  splenomegaly', '  systemic inflammatory response syndrome', '  thorax pain', '  thrombocytopenia', '  vertebral canal stenosis']",5.0,W.B.

433,Overview of circulating nucleic acids in plasma/serum: Update on potential prognostic and diagnostic value in diseases excluding fetal medicine and oncology,2008,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,"The existence of circulating nucleic acids in plasma and serum (CNAPS) was first described almost six decades ago. However, the prognostic and diagnostic utility of this circulating DNA/RNA has only really begun to be appreciated in the last decade. Earlier studies concentrated mainly on investigations concerned with fetal medicine and oncology, and significant progress was made in both specialities. More recently the field of enquiry has extended further, and attention has turned to other pathologic states, including trauma, sepsis, myocardial infarction, stroke, transplantation, diabetes mellitus, and hematologic disorders. In some of these studies, mitochondrial as well as genomic DNA and tissue-specific mRNA have been analyzed, either quantitatively or qualitatively or both, and have been shown to be modified in the presence of disease. While there is tremendous potential for CNAPS as a clinical modality, many of the emerging studies seem to be confined to a few dedicated labs. Therefore, additional independent studies are necessary in some cases in order to show reproducibility, which will further consolidate the field. Despite this shortcoming, and with the evidently increasing number of applications for CNAPS, it is highly likely that routine testing, as described, will become reality within the next 5 to 10 years. © 2008 New York Academy of Sciences.","['circulating DNA', '  circulating RNA', '  DNA', '  genomic DNA', '  messenger RNA', '  RNA', '  unclassified drug', '  blood disease', '  circulating nucleic acids in plasma and serum analysis', '  circulation', '  conference paper', '  diabetes mellitus', '  diagnostic value', '  heart infarction', '  histopathology', '  human', '  injury', '  mitochondrial DNA disorder', '  nucleic acid analysis', '  prognosis', '  qualitative analysis', '  quantitative analysis', '  sepsis', '  stroke', '  tissue specificity', '  transplantation']",100.0,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,English,Conference Paper,['United Kingdom'],[],['United Kingdom'],2004 - 2013,1

435,Analyzing cell mechanics in hematologic diseases with microfluidic biophysical flow cytometry,2008,Lab on a Chip,"Pathological processes in hematologic diseases originate at the single-cell level, often making measurements on individual cells more clinically relevant than population averages from bulk analysis. For this reason, flow cytometry has been an effective tool for single-cell analysis of properties using light scattering and fluorescence labeling. However, conventional flow cytometry cannot measure cell mechanical properties, alterations of which contribute to the pathophysiology of hematologic diseases such as sepsis, diabetic retinopathy, and sickle cell anemia. Here we present a high-throughput microfluidics-based 'biophysical' flow cytometry technique that measures single-cell transit times of blood cell populations passing through in vitro capillary networks. To demonstrate clinical relevance, we use this technique to characterize biophysical changes in two model disease states in which mechanical properties of cells are thought to lead to microvascular obstruction: (i) sepsis, a process in which inflammatory mediators in the bloodstream activate neutrophils and (ii) leukostasis, an often fatal and poorly understood complication of acute leukemia. Using patient samples, we show that cell transit time through and occlusion of microfluidic channels is increased for both disease states compared to control samples, and we find that mechanical heterogeneity of blood cell populations is a better predictor of microvascular obstruction than average properties. Inflammatory mediators involved in sepsis were observed to significantly affect the shape and magnitude of the neutrophil transit time population distribution. Altered properties of leukemia cell subpopulations, rather than of the population as a whole, were found to correlate with symptoms of leukostasis in patients-a new result that may be useful for guiding leukemia therapy. By treating cells with drugs that affect the cytoskeleton, we also demonstrate that their transit times could be significantly reduced. Biophysical flow cytometry offers a low-cost and high-throughput diagnostic and drug discovery platform for hematologic diseases that affect microcirculatory flow. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.","['acute leukemia', '  article', '  cell population', '  controlled study', '  flow cytometry', '  human', '  human cell', '  in vitro study', '  leukostasis', '  light scattering', '  microcirculation', '  microfluidic analysis', '  neutrophil', '  priority journal', '  sepsis']",237.0,Royal Society of Chemistry,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Heart, Blood Institute]",['United States'],2004 - 2013,1
436,Retinal photocoagulation for proliferative sickle cell retinopathy: A prospective clinical trial with new sea fan classification,2008,European Journal of Ophthalmology,"PURPOSE. To compare the clinical outcome of stage III proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (PSR) treated by peripheral retinal scatter photocoagulation to natural course disease. METHODS. Long-term follow-up of 101 patients enrolled in a prospective trial of photocoagulation for PSR has been completed. Among 202 eyes of 101 patients enrolled at the University Eye Clinic of Créteil, 73 eyes showed a stage III PSR, which the authors further divided into five new grades (A, B, C, D, E) considering size, hemorrhage, fibrosis, and visible vessels. Grading was based on a three-mirror fundus examination, 360° color photographs, and fluorescein angiography. Mean follow-up was 4 years. RESULTS. Thirty-eight treated eyes and 35 untreated eyes were included in this study. The evolution was not statistically significant between treated and untreated groups concerning flat sea fan <1 MPS disc area (grade A) or elevated sea fan with partial fibrosis (grade C). Progression and regression were compared between the two groups for grade B, resulting statistically significant (p<0.05). Nine complications (13%) were observed, which only occurred in untreated patients with elevated sea fan and hemorrhage (grade B) or complete fibrosed sea fan with well defined vessels (grade E) (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest that patients with grade A or C new sea fan classification should not be initially treated but observed. © Wichtig Editore, 2008.","['adult', '  argon plasma coagulation', '  article', '  clinical article', '  clinical trial', '  controlled study', '  disease classification', '  disease course', '  eye fundus', '  female', '  fluorescence angiography', '  follow up', '  human', '  intraocular hemorrhage', '  laser coagulation', '  male', '  ocular fibrosis', '  priority journal', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  proliferative sickle cell retinopathy', '  prospective study', '  sickle cell anemia', '  statistical significance', '  treatment outcome']",23.0,Wichtig Publishing Srl,English,Article,"['France', ' Italy']",[],['France'],2004 - 2013,2
437,A screening strategy for the detection of sickle cell retinopathy in pediatric patients,2008,Canadian Journal of Ophthalmology,"Background: Children with sickle cell hemoglobinopathy are referred routinely to detect retinopathy and thereby prevent vision-threatening complications. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and age of onset of clinically significant retinopathy in such patients, and to recommend a screening strategy for ophthalmologists. Methods: Two hundred sixty-three pediatric sickle cell patients to a maximum age of 18 years during the period of observation were reviewed for the onset of retinopathy, considering the influence of hemoglobin genotype, gender, and the presence of systemic manifestations. Results: Proliferative retinopathy (PR) was rare. Six cases (8.2%) of PR were seen in the SC genotype, I case (0.6%) in the SS genotype, and no cases in the SB-Thalassemia genotype. The age of onset of PR was a mean of 13.7 years (median 13, range 9-18) in the SC genotype and 16 years in the SS genotype. Neither gender nor the presence of systemic manifestations was predictive for the prevalence or age of onset of retinopathy. Interpretation: Screening for retinopathy may begin at age 9 years for SC genotype patients and at age 13 years for SS and SB-Thalassemia genotype patients. Serial examinations may be done biennially for eyes with normal findings. Patients with an abnormal examination should undergo fluorescein angiography and be followed as necessary.","['adolescent', '  article', '  child', '  clinical feature', '  female', '  genotype', '  hemoglobin blood level', '  human', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  prevalence', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  rare disease', '  retinopathy', '  screening test', '  sickle cell anemia', '  thalassemia']",37.0,Elsevier B.V.,English,Article,"['Canada', ' Canada']",[],"['Canada', 'Canada']",2004 - 2013,2
438,Sickle cell retinopathy and hemoglobinopathies,2007,Retinal Vascular Disease,"Sickle cell hemoglobinopathies all share the common feature of an abnormal globin chain, which leads to sickling of erythrocytes and obstruction of the microcirculation. Sickle vaso-occlusive events are insidious and affect virtually every vascular bed in the eye, often with visually devastating consequences. Vaso-occlusion most profoundly affects the retina, the light-sensitive tissue that lines the inside wall of the posterior aspect of the eye, because it is exquisitely sensitive to deprivation of oxygen. Even temporary vaso-occlusion, if longer than about 1.5-2 h, can result in permanent infarction of the retina. Most, if not all, of the complications of sickle cell disease in retina originate from the vaso-occlusive processes. The pathological changes can be divided into nonproliferative and proliferative events. © 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,0.0,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,English,Book Chapter,"['United Kingdom', ' Netherlands', ' United States']",[],['United States'],2004 - 2013,3
439,Inflammation as a stimulus for vascular leakage and proliferation,2007,Retinal Vascular Disease,"In the past few decades, our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying retinal vasoproliferation has increased greatly (see Chapters 2, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3). While vasoproliferation was once considered to be mainly a consequence of ischemia, current evidence also supports a contribution of inflammatory mechanisms. Inflammation is also highly related to vascular leakage in diseases that are known to result in retinal and macular edema. Recently, inflammatory mechanisms have gained interest with respect to the retinal pathology following ischemia, as well as in diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) and sickle cell retinopathy (see Chapter 27.1). In this chapter, the discussion will focus on the published data relating to the inflammatory mechanisms in ischemic retinal diseases such as DR. The definition of inflammation in this setting is the involvement of any leukocyte-mediated pathology in the course of the disease. © 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,1.0,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,English,Book Chapter,"['Germany', ' United States']",[],['Germany'],2004 - 2013,2
440,Peripheral retinal neovascularization in talc retinopathy,2007,Optometry,"Background: Neovascularization of the peripheral retina can be present in a number of systemic and ocular diseases. Very rarely, peripheral retinal neovascularization can also be manifested in intravenous drug abusers. In addition to ocular complications, intravenous drug abusers are at high risk for contracting various infections and the development of pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. We present a case of a chronic heroin and cocaine abuser with bilateral peripheral retinal neovascularization, pulmonary complications, and a history of endocarditis. Case report: A patient with a 20-year history of heroin and cocaine abuse initially presented for a routine eye examination. Fundus examination revealed pinpoint white deposits centered in both maculas, engorged vascular fronds with a patch of intraretinal hemorrhage in the peripheral retinal of the right eye and neovascularization of the disc as well as exudation with adjacent focal preretinal hemorrhage in the left eye. The patient underwent fluorescein angiography and was screened for diabetes, sarcoidosis, and sickle cell disease. When no systemic disease could be discovered, it was concluded that the peripheral retinal neovascularization developed as a result of vascular occlusion from heroin and cocaine abuse. Discussion: It is important to investigate the cause of neovascularization in the peripheral retina. Retinal vascular emboli such as talc are common in drug abusers, but in most cases, the retinal deposits pose only a minimal threat to vision. However, this case shows that careful retinal examination is warranted in drug abusers to rule out neovascularization of the retina. Other causes of peripheral retinal neovascularization should be ruled out as well. These conditions include sickle cell retinopathy, sarcoidosis, diabetic retinopathy, blood dyscrasias, retinal vascular occlusion, Eales' disease, and other systemic conditions, so that appropriate ocular and systemic treatment can be provided. Peripheral retinal neovascularization is best treated by pan-retinal photocoagulation. © 2007 American Optometric Association.","['talc', '  addiction', '  article', '  case report', '  chemically induced disorder', '  differential diagnosis', '  eye fundus', '  fluorescence angiography', '  human', '  male', '  middle aged', '  pathology', '  retina artery occlusion', '  retina neovascularization', '  Diagnosis', ' Differential', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Fundus Oculi', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Retinal Artery Occlusion', '  Retinal Neovascularization', '  Substance-Related Disorders', '  Talc']",2.0,,English,Article,"['United States', ' United States']",[],['United States'],2004 - 2013,2

443,Pulmonary hypertension in sickle-cell disease: Comorbidities and echocardiographic findings,2007,Acta Haematologica,"Background: Our aim is to determine comorbidities associated with pulmonary hypertension (PHT) in clinically stable sickle-cell disease (SCD) patients and to evaluate left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) function in those patients. Methods: Echocardiography was performed in 87 SCD patients that were divided into group I (without PHT) and group II (with PHT). Both groups were compared with healthy controls. Results: A history of retinopathy and leg ulcer was more frequent in group II than group I (p < 0.01). Haemoglobin levels were lower (p < 0.05), whereas blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase and total bilirubin levels were higher in group II (p < 0.01). Although group II patients had larger LV end-diastolic, LV end-systolic and RV diastolic diameters compared with group I patients and controls (p < 0.05), LV ejection fraction was similar in the three groups. The mitral peak early diastolic inflow velocity to peak late diastolic inflow velocity (E/A) ratio was similar in group I, group II and the control group. The tricuspid E/A ratio was lower in group II than group I and controls (p < 0.05). Conclusion: End organ damage occurs more often and haemolysis is severer in SCD patients with PHT than SCD patients without PHT. Although LV systolic and diastolic function is well preserved, RV diastolic function is disturbed in those patients with PHT. Copyright © 2007 S.

446,Retinopathy in patients with sickle cell trait,2007,Optometry,"Background: Sickle hemoglobinopathies are among the most prevalent genetic disorders in the United States. Sickle cell trait (hemoglobin AS) is the most common genotype and has traditionally been considered a benign condition. Systemic and ocular complications are seen infrequently in patients with sickle cell trait. In the presence of concomitant systemic diseases or trauma, however, marked retinopathy can occur. The presence of retinopathy in patients with sickle cell trait necessitates a comprehensive medical workup, including serologic testing to rule out systemic conditions. Case reports: Two cases are presented. The patient in case 1 is a 44-year-old black man with a positive history of sickle cell trait and uncontrolled hypertension. Best-corrected visual acuities (BCVAs) were 20/20 in the right eye (O.D.) and the left eye (O.S.). Retinal evaluation found vitreo-retinal fibrotic scaffolding and ""sea-fan"" neovascularization. The patient in case 2 is a 45-year-old black woman who presented after a stroke 1-month prior. Her medical history was positive for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, a recently diagnosed aneurismal dilation of the ascending thoracic aorta, and sickle cell trait. BCVAs were 20/20 O.D., and 20/20 O.S. A single dot hemorrhage was evident O.D., and an inferior-temporal branch retinal artery occlusion with an adjacent area of sea-fan neovascularization was observed O.S. Conclusion: Sickle cell disease remains a major public health concern because of its associated significant morbidity and mortality. Sickle cell trait is considered benign in a healthy patient. However, under conditions of stress, concomitant systemic diseases, or trauma leading to hypoxia, sickle cell trait can become a pathologic risk factor. © 2007 American Optometric Association.",,18.0,Elsevier Inc.,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],2004 - 2013,1

450,Smoking rates and the state of smoking interventions for children and adolescents with chronic illness,2006,Pediatrics,"Engaging in smoking is particularly risky for children and adolescents with chronic illness whose health status is already compromised because of disease- and treatment-related complications. Yet, some of these youngsters smoke at rates at least comparable to those of their healthy peers. To date, few randomized smoking-prevention and cessation trials have been conducted in children with chronic medical problems. In this review we report on the smoking rates among youngsters with chronic illness, identify specific disease- and treatment-related complications that can be exacerbated by smoking, examine risk factors associated with tobacco use among medically compromised youngsters, and review smoking interventions that have been conducted to date with pediatric populations in the health care setting. The following chronic illnesses are included in this review: asthma, cystic fibrosis, cancer, sickle cell disease, juvenile-onset diabetes, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Objectives for a tobacco-control agenda and recommendations for future tobacco studies in chronically ill pediatric populations are provided. Finally, tobacco counseling strategies are suggested for clinicians who treat these youngsters in their practices.

451,Combination erythropoietin-hydroxyurea therapy in sickle cell disease: Experience from the National Institutes of Health and a literature review,2006,Haematologica,"Erythropoietin is being used more widely in the management of sickle cell disease (SCD, inclusive of homozygous sickle beta, SS, and compound heterozygous sickle beta thalassemia, Sβ° thal), often in conjunction with hydroxyurea (HU). Herein, we summarize the published experience with erythropoietin use in SCD, in 39 patients (SS, n=30; Sβ° thal, n=9) who were treated between 1990 and 1996; and in 13 patients with sickle syndromes (SS, n=12, compound heterozygous SC disease, n=1) who were treated with erythropoietin or darbepoietin at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) since 2002. The dose range of erythropoietin for SCD in the published series, at a median of >200 U/Kg/dose, is higher than that used in end-stage renal disease. The median duration of erythropoietin therapy was ≥3 months, with minimal reported side-effects. At the NIH, the median age of sickle syndrome patients who received erythropoietin or darbepoietin (both referred to as EPO in the NIH series) was 51 (24 to 70) years; 12/13 patients had sickle-associated pulmonary hypertension. Eleven out of the 13 patients were treated with both HU and EPO for > 4 months (median of 11 months on EPO) without complication. Of the 13 patients, five (all SS) with pulmonary hypertension were given EPO for reticulocytopenia (<100,000/μL) on HU; 5/13 patients (all SS), with pulmonary hypertension, were given EPO and HU concurrently, in the light of an estimated glomerular filtration rate of <80 mL/minute. Three of the 13 patients (2 SS, 1 SC) were treated with EPO for miscellaneous reasons. Hematologic responses, detailed herein, suggest that EPO therapy may allow more aggressive HU dosing in high-risk SCD patients and in the setting of mild renal insufficiency, common to the aging sickle cell population. Furthermore EPO appears to be safe in SCD, particularly when used in conjunction with HU. We outline our current therapeutic strategy for EPO use in SCD. ©2006 Ferrata Storti Foundation.","['darbepoietin', '  erythropoietin', '  hydroxyurea', '  recombinant erythropoietin', '  unclassified drug', '  bone pain', '  cytopenia', '  disease association', '  drug dose regimen', '  drug efficacy', '  drug safety', '  drug tolerability', '  glomerulus filtration rate', '  health care organization', '  high risk patient', '  human', '  hypertension', '  kidney failure', '  pulmonary hypertension', '  pure red cell anemia', '  reticulocyte', '  retinopathy', '  review', '  sickle cell anemia', '  thrombosis', '  treatment duration', '  treatment outcome', '  vein occlusion', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Drug Therapy', ' Combination', '  Erythropoietin', '  Erythropoietin', ' Recombinant', '  Hematocrit', '  Humans', '  Hydroxyurea', '  National Institutes of Health (U.S.)', '  Treatment Outcome', '  United States']",51.0,,English,Review,['United States'],"[National Heart, Blood Institute, National Institute of Diabetes and, NIDDK, Z01DK075008]",['United States'],2004 - 2013,1

A total of 38 patients with the HbS gene were included over a 12-month study period. Retinal damage was assessed by a computerised angiofluorography in 31 patients. Of the 38 patients studied, 71 % had sickle cell disease (SC), 21 % had sickle cell trait (AS) and 8 % had sickle cell anemia (SS). Sixty-eight percent of patients (n = 21) presented sickle cell retinopathy. The age group with the highest prevalence of proliferative neovascularisation was between 26 and 35 years. Retinopathy was more frequent in SC patients than AS patients: 90 % (n = 19) versus 10 % (n = 2). None of the 3 SS patients presented retinopathy. Retinal neovascularisation was the most common finding in the 27 affected eyes. This study confirms the frequency and severity of retinal damage in patients with the HbS haemoglobin, particularly among young people with double heterozygous disease (SC) in the tropical African environment. Treatment of this disorder is largely unavailable to patients in sub-Saharan Africa except at the major eye care centres. An early screening and management programme for retinal damage related to SC would reduce ocular complications and optimise visual efficiency in these young active patients.","['hemoglobin', '  hemoglobin S', '  adult', '  angiogenesis', '  article', '  cell proliferation', '  clinical article', '  controlled study', '  disease duration', '  disease severity', '  fluorography', '  genotype', '  health program', '  hemoglobin blood level', '  heterozygote', '  human', '  morbidity', '  ophthalmology', '  prevalence', '  retina injury', '  sickle cell anemia', '  visual acuity', '  fluorescence angiography', '  genetics', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  Mali', '  prospective study', '  retina disease', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Hemoglobin SC Disease', '  Hemoglobin', ' Sickle', '  Heterozygote', '  Humans', '  Mali', '  Prospective Studies', '  Retinal Diseases']",10.0,,French,Article,['Mali'],[],['Mali'],2004 - 2013,1
453,Single gene disorders causing ischaemic stroke,2006,Journal of Neurology,"Stroke is the third most common cause of death and the leading cause of long-term neurological disability in the world. Conventional vascular risk factors for stroke contribute approximately to only forty to fifty percent of stroke risk. Genetic factors may therefore contribute to a significant proportion of stroke and may be polygenic, monogenic or multi-factorial. Monogenic (single gene) disorders may potentially account for approximately one percent of all ischaemic stroke. Monogenic stroke disorders include conditions such as cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL) and hereditary endotheliopathy, retinopathy, nephropathy and stroke (HERNS). In addition, other monogenic conditions such as sickle cell and Fabry disease also lead to stroke. These monogenic disorders cause either small vessel or large vessel stroke (or a combination of both) and serve as useful models for understanding and studying conventional stroke and cerebrovascular disease and its accompaniments such as vascular dementia.","['CADASIL', '  cause of death', '  cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy', '  cerebroretinal vasculopathy', '  cerebrospinal fluid analysis', '  cerebrovascular accident', '  clinical feature', '  disability', '  disease association', '  dyslipidemia', '  Ehlers Danlos syndrome', '  Fabry disease', '  familial hemiplegic migraine', '  genetic analysis', '  genetic counseling', '  genetic risk', '  hereditary endotheliopathy retinopathy nephropathy and stroke', '  homocystinuria', '  human', '  Marfan syndrome', '  MELAS syndrome', '  moyamoya disease', '  multiinfarct dementia', '  neurofibromatosis', '  neuroimaging', '  priority journal', '  pseudoxanthoma elasticum', '  Rendu Osler Weber disease', '  review', '  risk factor', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Cerebrovascular Accident', '  Genetic Diseases', ' Inborn', '  Humans', '  Mutation', '  Stroke']",53.0,,English,Review,['United Kingdom'],[],['United Kingdom'],2004 - 2013,1

455,"Ocular findings in children with severe clinical symptoms of homozygous sickle cell anaemia in Kaduna, Nigeria",2006,West African Journal of Medicine,"Background: Sight-threatening retinopathy in Sickle Cell Disease is thought to be due mainly to vasoocclusion. Yet it is reportedly rarely found in children with Haemoglobin SS, (who most often suffer from vasoocclusion). However, earlier reports included patients with a wide range of clinical severity. Aim: To document ocular pathology in children with Haemoglobin SS with severe clinical disease. Methods: Thirty-seven children with severe clinical disease (at least 3 vaso-occlusive episodes in one year) had detailed ocular examinations over a one-year period. Results: No child (aged 3 to 13 years) had ocular symptoms. Visual acuity was abnormal in one child. Retinal pathology was found only in patients over 8 years. Neovascularization was observed in 3 eyes of 2 patients both of whom had higher than average irreversibly sickled cell counts and haemoglobin levels. Retinal and choroidal infarcts were found in 11 and 2 eyes respectively; sunburst lesions and salmon patch haemorrhages in 5 eyes each. Changes observed over the one-year period in the 32 survivors, were photocoagulation scars in one eye of a child who had undergone laser therapy and resolution of the salmon patch haemorrhages. Conclusion: Despite lack of visual symptoms, young children with haemoglobin SS with severe clinical symptoms can develop sight-threatening retinopathy. The possible role of autoinfarction in the causation of these lesions is discussed. Our study shows that routine yearly ophthalmological examinations are essential for children over 8 years.","['cyclopentolate', '  hemoglobin S', '  narcotic analgesic agent', '  nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent', '  phenylephrine', '  adolescent', '  anterior eye segment', '  article', '  cell count', '  child', '  choroid disease', '  clinical article', '  clinical feature', '  disease severity', '  electrophoresis', '  eye disease', '  female', '  follow up', '  hemoglobin blood level', '  human', '  intraocular hemorrhage', '  laser coagulation', '  low level laser therapy', '  male', '  Nigeria', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  prospective study', '  retina blood vessel occlusion', '  retina neovascularization', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell', '  sickle cell anemia', '  slit lamp', '  visual acuity', '  visual system examination', '  Adolescent', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Child', '  Child', ' Preschool', '  Eye', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Light Coagulation', '  Male', '  Neovascularization', ' Pathologic', '  Nigeria', '  Prospective Studies', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Severity of Illness Index']",21.0,,English,Article,"['Niger', ' Nigeria']",[],"['Niger', 'Nigeria']",2004 - 2013,2

457,The clinical impact of MTHFR polymorphism on the vascular complications of sickle cell disease,2006,Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common inherited diseases in the world and the patients present notorious clinical heterogeneity. It is known that patients with SCD present activation of the blood coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, especially during vaso-occlusive crises, but also during the steady state of the disease. We determined if the presence of the factor V gene G1691A mutation (factor V Leiden), the prothrombin gene G20210A variant, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism may be risk factors for vascular complications in individuals with SCD. We studied 53 patients with SCD (60% being women), 29 with SS (sickle cell anemia; 28 years, range: 13-52 years) and 24 with SC (sickle-hemoglobin C disease; 38.5 years, range: 17-72 years) hemoglobinopathy. Factor V Leiden, MTHFR C677T polymorphism, and prothrombin G20210A variant were identified by PCR followed by further digestion of the PCR product with specific endonucleases. The following vascular complications were recorded: stroke, retinopathy, acute thoracic syndrome, and X-ray-documented avascular necrosis. Only one patient was heterozygous for factor V Leiden (1.8%) and there was no prothrombin G20210A variant. MTHFR 677TT polymorphism was detected in 1 patient (1.8%) and the heterozygous form 677TC was observed in 18 patients (34%, 9 with SS and 9 with SC disease), a prevalence similar to that reported by others. No association was detected between the presence of the MTHFR 677T allele and other genetic modulation factors, such as α-thalassemia, ß-globin gene haplotype and fetal hemoglobin. The presence of the MTHFR 677T allele was associated with the occurrence of vascular complications in SCD, although this association was not significant when each complication was considered separately. In conclusion, MTHFR C677T polymorphism might be a risk factor for vascular complications in SCD. © 2007 Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research.","['5', '10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (FADH2)', '  beta globin', '  blood clotting factor 5 Leiden', '  endonuclease', '  hemoglobin F', '  prothrombin', '  adolescent', '  adult', '  aged', '  allele', '  alpha thalassemia', '  article', '  avascular necrosis', '  controlled study', '  female', '  genetic polymorphism', '  genetic variability', '  haplotype', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  hemoglobinopathy', '  heredity', '  heterozygosity', '  human', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  polymerase chain reaction', '  prevalence', '  retinopathy', '  risk factor', '  sickle cell anemia', '  stroke', '  thorax outlet syndrome', '  vascular disease']",27.0,Associacao Brasileira de Divulgacao Cientifica,English,Article,['Brazil'],[],['Brazil'],2004 - 2013,1

Endothelial injury or dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diverse vascular diseases. Studies in vitro have demonstrated that a wide variety of stimuli can induce programmed cell death (apoptosis) of endothelial cells, and have suggested that apoptosis could be an important mechanism of vascular injury, resulting in vascular leak, inflammation, and coagulation. In this review, we focus on the potential role of endothelial apoptosis in the initiation and progression of inflammatory and immune disorders, reviewing human diseases and in vivo models in which endothelial cell apoptosis has been demonstrated. Although endothelial cell apoptosis is observed in many inflammatory and immune disorders, we find that there is, as yet, only limited experimental evidence demonstrating that it is critical to the pathogenesis of disease. © 2005 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.","['angiogenic factor', '  death receptor', '  growth factor', '  immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein', '  toll like receptor', '  apoptosis', '  atherosclerosis', '  blood clotting', '  conference paper', '  congestive heart failure', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  disease model', '  emphysema', '  endothelium injury', '  graft rejection', '  human', '  immunopathology', '  in vivo study', '  inflammatory disease', '  nonhuman', '  priority journal', '  scleroderma', '  sickle cell anemia', '  systemic lupus erythematosus', '  thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura', '  vascular disease', '  Animals', '  Apoptosis', '  Endothelial Cells', '  Endothelium', ' Vascular', '  Humans', '  Hypertension', '  Immune System Diseases', '  Inflammation', '  Models', ' Biological', '  NF-kappa B', '  Purpura', ' Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic', '  Reperfusion Injury', '  Stress', ' Mechanical']",129.0,,English,Conference Paper,['United States'],"[National Heart, Blood Institute, National Institute of General Medical Sciences]",['United States'],2004 - 2013,1
460,"Phosphatase enzyme histochemistry for studying vascular hierarchy, pathology, and endothelial cell dysfunction in retina and choroid",2005,Vision Research,"Phosphatase enzymes cleave an inorganic phosphate from a substrate. Phosphatase enzyme histochemistry followed by flat-embedding in glycol methacrylate is extremely useful in studying retinal and choroidal vascular development and loss, since only viable blood vessels have these enzyme activities. Sites of occlusion and remodeling can be identified and analysed, resulting in new insights into the cause of occlusion. The phosphatase activities are elevated in neovascularization making possible high resolution analysis of neovascularization, the feeder vessels, and the retinal milieu in which angiogenesis occurs. Adenosine diphosphatase (ADPase) catalyzes ADP to an inorganic phosphate plus adenosine monophosphate, preventing accumulation of ADP, one of the most potent stimuli for platelet aggregation. The ADPase technique can be used in any species but this report highlights its use in dog and human retinas. The ADPase technique has yielded important insights into vaso-occlusive and vasoproliferative processes in retinopathy of prematurity, sickle cell and diabetic retinopathies. The alkaline phosphatase flatembedding technique is useful in evaluating dog, cat, and human choroidal vasculatures. It has permitted quantification of the loss of choriocapillaris in diabetic choroidopathy and of the RPE and choriocapillaris in geographic atrophy and exudative age-related macular degeneration. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

461,Outcome of sickle cell anemia: A 4-decade observational study of 1056 patients,2005,Medicine,"Based on a prospective cohort study of 1056 patients with sickle cell anemia (Hb SS) initiated in 1959, we investigated the influence of calendar era, age, sex, and prior medical conditions on the subsequent development of irreversible organ damage and survival using the Cox regression model with time-dependent co-variates adjusting for all prior occurrences. We studied 30 acute clinical events, and focused on 8 prototypic forms of irreversible organ damage. Childhood survival to age 20 years has improved from 79% for those born before 1975 to 89% for children born in or after 1975. Bone infarction was a significant risk factor for avascular necrosis (p = 0.01), and infantile dactylitis was a significant risk factor for stroke (p = 0.01). Prior hospitalized vaso-occlusive sickle crisis in adults was significantly associated with the increased rate of avascular necrosis (p < 0.001), leg ulcers (p < 0.001), sickle chronic lung disease (p < 0.001), renal failure (p < 0.005), and early death (p < 0.001). The diagnosis of clearly evident clinical conditions such as leg ulcer, osteonecrosis, and retinopathy predicted an increased likelihood of developing a more lethal form of organ damage and earlier death: 77% of patients with chronic lung disease, 75% of those with renal insufficiency, and 51% of those with stroke had a prior chronic condition. Of the 232 patients who died, 73% had 1 or more clinically recognized forms of irreversible organ damage. By the fifth decade, nearly one-half of the surviving patients (48%) had documented irreversible organ damage. End-stage renal disease (glomerulosclerosis), chronic pulmonary disease with pulmonary hypertension, retinopathy, and cerebral micro-infarctions are manifestations of arterial and capillary microcirculation obstructive vasculopathy. The current study underscores the need for preventive therapy to ameliorate the progression of the sickle vasculopathy.

466,"A brief review of the pathophysiology, associated pain, and psychosocial issues in sickle cell disease",2005,International Journal of Behavioral Medicine,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic disorder of the blood. The disease produces significantly abnormal hemoglobin (Hgb) molecules in red blood cells (RBCs). The sickling of RBCs occurs when partially or totally deoxygenated Hgb molecules distort their normal disk shape, producing stiff, sticky, sickle-shaped cells that obstruct small blood vessels and produce vasoocclusion as well as the disruption of oxygen to body tissues. Because tissue damage can occur at multiple foci, patients with SCD are at risk for other medical complications including, but not limited to, delayed growth and sexual maturation; acute and chronic pulmonary dysfunction; stroke; aseptic necrosis of the hip, shoulders, or both; sickle cell retinopathy; dermal ulcers; and severe chronic pain. The chronicity of the illness combined with frequent hospitalizations for pain and other medical management can contribute significantly to impaired psychosocial functioning, altered intra- and interpersonal relationships, and reduced quality of life. Unlike previous qualitative reviews of SCD, this article describes the relevant clinical and research data on the relation between psychosocial functioning and SCD in adult and child populations. The authors discuss the significant role of psychosocial issues in the trajectory and management of the disease and conclude that understanding the pathophysiology of SCD without thoroughly understanding the equally important psychosocial influences is misunderstanding SCD.

467,"The angiopoietin/Tie-2 system in proliferative sickle retinopathy: Relation to vascular endothelial growth factor, its soluble receptor Flt-1 and von Willebrand factor, and to the effects of laser treatment",2005,British Journal of Ophthalmology,"Aim: To determine plasma levels of angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-1, Ang-2), their soluble receptor Tie-2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), its soluble receptor Flt-1 (as indices of angiogenesis), and von Willebrand factor (vWf, marking endothelial damage/ dysfunction) in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients with proliferate sickle retinopathy (PSR), with non-proliferative retinopathy (NPR), or no retinopathy (NR) and in control subjects with normal haemoglobin (AA subjects). In addition, to determine changes with panretinal laser photocoagulation (PRP) therapy. Methods: Research indices were measured (ELISA) in 24 SCD patients who had PSR, 16 with NPR, 16 with NR, and from 23 AA subjects. Eight patients received PRP therapy and plasma was obtained before laser treatment and at 6 months after the last PRP session. Results: Ang-1, Ang-2, VEGF, and vWf (but not Tie-2 or sFlt-1) were raised in SCD patients compared to AA subjects (p<0.01) but there were no differences among the three SCD subgroups. Significant correlations were between Ang-1 and VEGF, Ang-1 and Tie-2, and VEGF and sFlt-1 in patients with SCD (r=0.67-0.88). Plasma Ang-2, VEGF, sFlt-1, and vWf levels did not change, but Ang-1 fell and Tie-2 rose significantly following PRP therapy. Conclusions: SCD patients have raised plasma angiopoietins (Ang-1, Ang-2), VEGF, and vWf compared to AA subjects. These indices did not differ according to severity of retinopathy and only limited changes occurred following PRP. The elevated growth factor levels in SCD may have obscured any association with retinopathy.","['angiopoietin 1', '  angiopoietin 2', '  hemoglobin', '  vasculotropin', '  vasculotropin receptor 1', '  von Willebrand factor', '  adult', '  angiogenesis', '  article', '  clinical article', '  correlation analysis', '  diagnostic value', '  disease severity', '  enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', '  female', '  hemoglobin determination', '  human', '  laser coagulation', '  low level laser therapy', '  male', '  pathogenesis', '  priority journal', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  proliferative sickle retinopathy', '  protein protein interaction', '  retinopathy', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Angiopoietin-1', '  Angiopoietin-2', '  Angiopoietins', '  Cohort Studies', '  Cross-Sectional Studies', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Laser Coagulation', '  Male', '  Receptor', ' TIE-2', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', '  Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1', '  von Willebrand Factor']",26.0,,English,Article,['United Kingdom'],[],['United Kingdom'],2004 - 2013,1
468,Nonhuman primate models for diabetic ocular neovascularization using AAV2-mediated overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor,2005,Diabetes,"Neovascularization leads to blindness in numerous ocular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, retinopathy of prematurity, and sickle cell disease. More effective and stable treatments for ocular neovascularization are needed, yet there are major limitations in the present animal models. To develop primate models of diabetic retinopathy and choroidal neovascularization, rhesus monkeys were injected subretinally or intravitreally with an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-2 vector carrying the cDNA encoding human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Overexpression of VEGF was measured by intraocular fluid sampling over time. Neovascularization was evaluated by opthalmoscopy through angiography, optical coherence tomography, and ultimately histopathology. Overexpression of VEGF through AAV2 results in rapid development of features of diabetic retinopathy or macular edema, depending on the targeted cell type/mode of production of VEGF and diffusion of VEGF. Nonhuman primate models will be useful in testing long-term safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents for blinding neovascular diseases. © 2005 by the American Diabetes Association.","['complementary DNA', '  parvovirus vector', '  vasculotropin', '  animal experiment', '  animal model', '  animal tissue', '  aqueous humor', '  article', '  blindness', '  cell type', '  controlled study', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  experimental model', '  female', '  gene overexpression', '  histopathology', '  immunohistochemistry', '  nonhuman', '  nucleotide sequence', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  optical coherence tomography', '  polymerase chain reaction', '  priority journal', '  protein expression', '  retina angiography', '  retina macula age related degeneration', '  retina macula edema', '  retrolental fibroplasia', '  rhesus monkey', '  sickle cell anemia', '  subretinal neovascularization', '  technique', '  viral gene delivery system', '  Adenoviridae', '  Animals', '  Dependovirus', '  Diabetic Retinopathy', '  Disease Models', ' Animal', '  Female', '  Gene Expression', '  Macaca mulatta', '  Retina', '  Retinal Neovascularization', '  Time Factors', '  Transfection', '  Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', '  Viruses']",60.0,,English,Article,"['Italy', ' United States']",[National Eye Institute],['United States'],2004 - 2013,2

This study looked for retinopathy in a cohort of 90 Nigerians with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Method: The cohort consisted of black Nigerians from the Hausa-Fulani, Ibo and Yoruba, as well as other minority ethnic groups resident in the Federal Capital Territory aged between 5-36 yr. 88 patients were SS and only 2 SC. Results: SCD related posterior lesions were seen in 22 patients (24%). Of these, 19 cases (21%) had Non Proliferative Sickle Retinopathy (NPSR) while 5 (5.6%) had Proliferative Sickle Retinopathy (PSR) in various stages of development, and 2 had both PSR and NPSR. Patients with PSR are at risk of blindness from vitreous haemorrhage and tractional retinal detachment. A 14-year-old male with arterio-venous anastomosis was the youngest with PSR while the most advanced PSR lesion was a sea fan in a 25-year-old female. Conclusions: standard treatment consisting of photocoagulation and/or vitrectomy is not available in many eye centres in sub-Saharan Africa and steps need to be taken to improve this situation.

Design: Prospective longitudinal study over 20 years. Participants: Newborn screening of 100000 consecutive deliveries from 1973 to 1981 identified 315 children with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease and 201 with SS-hemoglobin C (SC) disease. By the age of 5 years, 307 SS patients and 166 SC patients were alive and living in Jamaica and were recruited for this ophthalmic study. Methods: Description of retinal vascular changes on annual angiography and angioscopy. Main Outcome Measures: Incidence and prevalence of PSR and its behavior on follow-up. Progression of PSR was investigated using the number of eyes affected (none, one, both) and the interval until PSR onset. Results: At last review in January 2000, PSR had developed in 59 patients (14 SS, 45 SC), unilaterally in 36 patients and bilaterally in 23. Incidence increased with age in both genotypes, with crude annual incidence rates of 0.5 cases (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3-0.8) per 100 SS subjects and 2.5 cases (95% CI, 1.9-3.3) per 100 SC subjects. Prevalence was greater in SC disease, and by the ages of 24 to 26 years, PSR had occurred in 43% subjects with SC disease and in 14% subjects with SS disease. Patients with unilateral PSR had a 16% (11% SS, 17% SC) probability of regressing to no PSR and a 14% (16% SS, 13% SC) probability of progressing to bilateral PSR. Those with bilateral PSR had an 8% (8% SS, 8% SC) probability of regressing to unilateral PSR and a 1% (0 SS, 2% SC) probability of regressing to a PSR-free state. Irretrievable visual loss occurred in only 1 of 82 PSR-affected eyes, and 1 required detachment surgery and recovered normal visual acuity. Conclusions: Longitudinal observations over 20 years in a cohort of patients followed from birth confirms a greater incidence and severity of PSR in SC disease, and shows that spontaneous regression occurred in 32% of PSR-affected eyes. Permanent visual loss was uncommon in subjects observed up to the age of 26 years. © 2005 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.","['adolescent', '  adult', '  angioscopy', '  child', '  clinical feature', '  confidence interval', '  controlled study', '  disease course', '  disease severity', '  female', '  genotype', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  homozygote', '  human', '  Jamaica', '  longitudinal study', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  newborn screening', '  prevalence', '  priority journal', '  probability', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  proliferative sickle cell retinopathy', '  retina', '  retina angiography', '  retina detachment', '  review', '  sickle cell anemia', '  visual acuity', '  visual impairment']",140.0,Elsevier Inc.,English,Article,"['United Kingdom', ' Jamaica', ' United States']","[Wellcome Trust, WT]",['United Kingdom'],2004 - 2013,3

475,Sickle cell trait and gender influence type 2 diabetic complications in African patients,2004,European Journal of Internal Medicine,"Black and African patients with type 2 diabetes have a greater frequency and more severe vascular complications of the disease, even after correction for socioeconomic factors. Asymptomatic sickle cell trait (SCT; hemoglobin AS) is also common among black Africans and may independently cause endothelial damage, manifested as isolated target organ complication or infarction. We examined the possibility that patients with concurrent type 2 diabetes and SCT may be predisposed to more frequent or severe diabetic macro- or microvascular complications than those without SCT. Fifty-two type 2 diabetic patients were divided into four groups, according to gender and hemoglobin genotype (normal: AA or SCT: AS). The groups were well matched for age and for clinical and demographic parameters. Diabetic complications were assessed in each patient and scored. Hemoglobin genotype was determined by hemoglobin-gel electrophoresis. Statistical comparisons were made between the groups. The composite complication score for vascular disease differed significantly according to gender and genotype (p<0.027 ANOVA). Male diabetics with SCT had a higher risk ratio (RR 1.6, p<0.02) for complications than those with normal hemoglobin; however, this was not the case with female diabetics. Among the male diabetics with SCT, there was a significantly greater proportion with proteinuria (p<0.02) or retinopathy (p<0.05) than among those with a normal hemoglobin genotype. Multiple regression analysis showed that gender and SCT were independent predictors of the vascular complication severity score and that exclusion of hemoglobin genotype weakened the predictability of the regression. A significantly higher proportion of male than female diabetics had at least one detectable complication. Systolic or diastolic blood pressure had no significant impact on the regressions. Male gender and SCT may adversely affect the expression of microvascular diabetic complications in Africans. Diabetic patients from populations predisposed to the sickle gene should be screened for the trait as part of their initial risk assessment. Large-scale studies on the impact of hemoglobin genotype on diabetic complications are clearly indicated. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The most severe complication in sickle cell disease (SCD) is proliferative retinopathy, a condition frequently observed in compound heterozygosis Hb S/Hb C. In this paper we describe the ophthalmologic involvement in a Sicilian population with SCD. Methods. We studied 142 patients with SCD followed at the Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology of the University of Catania. Forty of these patients had SS disease (β sβ s), 65 S-β 0 thalassemia (β sβ 0th) and 37 S-β + thalassemia (β sBs +th). All patients underwent ophthalmologic examination; patients with severe retinal vessel abnormalities also underwent fluorescein angiography. χ 2 test was used for statistical analysis. Results. We observed a moderate retinal vessel narrowing and tortuosity without crossings of artero-venous vessels in 11 SS patients (27.5%), in 23 S-β 0th patients (35.3%) and in 9 S-β +th patients (24.3%), and severe retinal vessel narrowing and tortuosity with crossings of artero-venous vessels in 4 SS patients (10%), and in 5 patients S-β 0th (7.6%). No statistically significant correlation was observed between retinal vessel narrowing and tortuosity and hematological data, number of pain crisis/year and age. Conclusions. The lower rate of ophthalmologic complications in Sicilian patients compared to black populations, may be related to the higher mean Hb F levels of Sicilian patients than those usually associated with the Benin type β s haplotype.","['hemoglobin F', '  hemoglobin S', '  adolescent', '  adult', '  article', '  beta thalassemia', '  child', '  clinical feature', '  disease severity', '  fluorescence angiography', '  haplotype', '  human', '  Italy', '  major clinical study', '  retina blood vessel', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia']",0.0,,English,Article,['Italy'],[],['Italy'],2004 - 2013,1

Sickle disease is fundamentally an inflammatory state, with activation of the endothelium, probably through proximate effects of reperfusion injury physiology and chronic molestation by adherent red cells and white cells. The disease also involves enhanced angiogenic propensity, activation of coagulation, disordered vasoregulation, and a component of chronic vasculopathy.

480,Ocular findings in sickle cell disease patients in Lagos.,2004,The Nigerian postgraduate medical journal,"Sickle cell disease has varied manifestations in all systems of the body, ocular manifestations can be severe and sudden blindness may result amidst other complications. The study aims at determining the ocular findings in patients with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) and sickle cell haemoglobin C disease (HbSC). 99 subjects were recruited into the study carried out at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital over a 2 year period. A structured interview questionnaire was administered and physical examination was carried out at the Medical Out Patients' Sickle Cell Clinics. Subsequently in the (Guinness) Eye centre, examination for ocular manifestations was carried out using Snellen's chart, Slit light microscopy, direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy under mydriasis (with Gutt Tropicamide 1% , epinephrine 10% ) as well as tonometry and gonioscopy. The age of the 99 (51 males, 48 females) patients ranged from 13 to 43 years with a mean +/-SD of 20.42 +/- 6.13. There were 88 (88.9% ) SS and 11 (11.1% ) SC patients. The male to female ratio was 1.1: 1. Normal vision was present in 95 (96% ) of the patients [86 (97.8% ) SS and 9 (81.8% ) SC] while 4 (4.0% ) of the patients [2 (2.2% ) SS and 2 (18.2% ) SC] had impaired vision. Of the complaints, blurred vision was found in 12 (13.6% ) SS and one (9.0% ) SC patients. Itching of the eyes was found in 15 (17.0% ) SS and 3 (27.3% ) SC patients. Icterus was found in 50 (50.5% ), conjunctival signs were found in 49 (49.5% ), retinal vascular tortuosity was in 12 (12 .10% ), peripheral retinal degeneration was in 5 (5% ), iridescent spots was in 3 (3% ) and optic atrophy in 2 (2% ) patients. The tortuosity of major fundus vessels were graded into 4 according to Hook and Cooper's criteria 87 (87.9% ) of the patients were in grade 0. The conjunctival vessels anomalies were classified into 5 grades (criteria of Sergeant). 37 (37.5% ) were in grade 0, 35 (35.3% ) in grade 1, 8 (8.1% ) in grade 2, 7 (7.1% ) in grade 3 and 12 (12.1% ) in grade 4. Conjunctival abnormalities occur commonly while proliferative retinopathy and optic atrophy were uncommon in sickle cell disease patients in Lagos. Further studies are required with a larger number of subjects to investigate the low incidence of proliferative retinopathy and optic atrophy in Lagos.","['adolescent', '  adult', '  article', '  eye disease', '  female', '  human', '  male', '  Nigeria', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Eye Diseases', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Nigeria']",15.0,,English,Article,"['Niger', ' Nigeria']",[],[],2004 - 2013,2
481,Pseudotumor cerebri in children with sickle cell disease: a case series.,2004,Pediatrics,"Headache is a frequent symptom in sickle cell disease (SCD) that usually is attributable to anemia or cerebrovascular disease. We report 3 pediatric patients with SCD (1 patient with SCD-SC and 2 patients with SCD-SS) who presented with headache and were diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri (PC). All 3 patients had elevated opening pressures during a lumbar puncture with normal cerebrospinal fluid studies. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed no evidence of hydrocephalus or arteriopathy in all 3 cases. Magnetic resonance venograms performed in 2 of the patients at diagnosis revealed no evidence of cerebral sinus thrombosis. Each patient received a thorough ophthalmologic examination. A diagnostic funduscopic examination revealed bilateral papilledema without signs of retinopathy in all 3 patients. There were no clinically significant changes in visual acuity or abnormalities of color vision in any patient. Goldmann or Humphrey visual-field assessment was abnormal only in patient 1, who demonstrated bilaterally enlarged blind spots at diagnosis and later developed reduced sensitivity in the inferomedial quadrant of the left eye in an arcuate pattern (which later resolved). The diagnosis of PC was made in all 3 patients, and acetazolamide treatment was started. Two of the patients' symptoms resolved completely with medical treatment, whereas the third patient's symptoms improved. None of these patients had permanent visual-field deficits as a result of their syndrome. PC has been reported in several other types of anemia including SCD-SC, but these cases are the first reported in conjunction with pediatric SCD. Early recognition of the signs and symptoms of PC in patients with SCD who present with headache can expedite proper diagnosis and treatment and prevent long-term ophthalmologic sequelae.","['carbonate dehydratase inhibitor', '  adolescent', '  article', '  brain pseudotumor', '  case report', '  child', '  female', '  headache', '  human', '  papilledema', '  sickle cell anemia', '  visual disorder', '  Adolescent', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors', '  Child', '  Female', '  Headache', '  Humans', '  Papilledema', '  Pseudotumor Cerebri', '  Vision Disorders']",45.0,,English,Article,['United States'],[],[],2004 - 2013,1

483,Expression of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in sickle cell retina and choroid,2003,Experimental Eye Research,"Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) has been shown to be an inhibitor of angiogenesis as well as a multipotent neurotrophic factor in the mammalian eye. Changes in PEDF levels have been correlated with development of retinal neovascularization in oxygen-induced retinopathy. The purpose of this study was to determine the localization and relative level of PEDF in human retinas and choroids using immunohistochemistry and evaluate the changes in PEDF and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) localization and their relation to the progression of proliferative sickle cell retinopathy. Cryopreserved tissues from eyes of normal subjects and subjects with non-proliferative or proliferative sickle cell retinopathy were used with streptavidin peroxidase immunohistochemistry. A rabbit polyclonal antibody was made against recombinant human PEDF. Binding of the antibody was blocked by preincubation of the antibody with excess human recombinant PEDF. Relative levels of immunoreactivity were scored with a seven-point grading system and by microdensitometric analysis. The most prominent sites of PEDF localization in the normal eye were the vitreous condensed at the internal limiting membrane and RPE-Bruch's membrane-choriocapillaris complex. PEDF was also prominent in choroidal stroma. There was limited immunoreactivity in some cells of the neural retinas, in blood vessels and in the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM). There was no difference in ratio (1.47 vs. 1.44) of PEDF/VEGF or the relative levels of either growth factor in the retinal vasculatures of the control subjects and perfused area of non-proliferative sickle cell retinas. The ratio was increased in the non-perfused area of the non-proliferative sickle cell retinas (2.24). In eyes with proliferative sickle cell retinopathy, elevated PEDF and VEGF immunostaining was present in viable vessels of sea fan neovascular formations as well as feeder vessels of sea fans. The PEDF/VEGF ratio in sea fans was 1.0. Immunoreactivity for PEDF was prominent in retinal vessels in non-perfused regions and in atrophic sea fans, while VEGF immunoreactivity was weak or absent in these structures. In conclusion, PEDF and VEGF were both significantly elevated in viable sea fan formations in sickle cell disease (p<0.05) but only PEDF was present in non-viable sea fans. The highest levels of PEDF in all eyes were associated with extracellular matrices (vitreous, choroidal stroma, IPM, and walls of blood vessels). PEDF might play an important role in inhibiting angiogenesis and inducing the regression of sea fans. Progression of angiogenesis may be dependent on the ratio of PEDF/VEGF. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

484,HCV in sickle cell disease,2003,Journal of the National Medical Association,"The sickle cell gene is common in the U.S. In fact 8% of African Americans are healthy carriers of the sickle cell trait (HbAS). People who are homozygous (HbSS) have severe disease. They have life-long anemia, chronic hemolysis, and also have at times hematological crises, which can worsen the anemia. Many patients require chronic transfusions and as a result, substantial proportions of sickle cell patients are at high risk for infection with blood-borne diseases - such as Hepatitis C Virus infection (HCV). The HCV antibody positivity is directly related to the number of transfusions given, and on average the prevalence rate in transfused patients is more than 10%. It is known that the combination of iron overload and HCV can lead to a more rapidly progressive liver disease. The treatment of HCV in sickle cell patients poses a challenge to clinicians. A novel approach described by some is the pre-treatment of these patients with hydroxyurea to increase the fetal hemoglobin, therefore decreasing the severity of Ribavirin-related hemolysis. Treatment with Peg-interferon, alone has not been used to treat HCV in sickle cell patients, but in the setting of controlled clinical trials it would be feasible. This review explores the impact of HCV in sickle cell patients and the possible therapeutic options available to them.","['hemoglobin F', '  hepatitis C antibody', '  hydroxyurea', '  interferon', '  peginterferon alpha2a', '  ribavirin', '  alopecia', '  anemia', '  antibody production', '  autoantibody induction', '  autoimmune disease', '  blood transfusion', '  cardiotoxicity', '  clinical feature', '  depression', '  disease severity', '  drug effect', '  drug efficacy', '  erythema', '  fatigue', '  flu like syndrome', '  gout', '  hemolysis', '  hepatitis C', '  Hepatitis C virus', '  high risk population', '  homozygote', '  human', '  infection risk', '  iron overload', '  leukopenia', '  liver disease', '  nausea', '  negro', '  nose congestion', '  paranoia', '  polyneuropathy', '  prevalence', '  priority journal', '  pruritus', '  retinopathy', '  review', '  risk factor', '  seizure', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell trait', '  side effect', '  suicidal behavior', '  suicidal ideation', '  taste disorder', '  taste perversion', '  thrombocytopenia', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Antiviral Agents', '  Blood Transfusion', '  Chronic Disease', '  Comorbidity', '  Disease Progression', '  Genotype', '  Hepacivirus', '  Hepatitis C', '  Humans', '  Interferons', '  Liver', '  Prevalence', '  Ribavirin', '  United States']",15.0,,English,Review,"['Georgia', ' United States']",[],"['Georgia', 'United States']",1994 - 2003,2
485,Estrogen protects the inner retina from apoptosis and ischemia-induced loss of Vesl-1L/Homer 1c immunoreactive synaptic connections,2003,Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science,"PURPOSE. Protective effects of estrogen on nerve cells including retinal neurons have been described previously. However, subcellular effects on synaptic connectivity in mild ischemia more closely resembling ischemic conditions found in diabetic or sickle cell retinopathy and stenosis of the carotid artery have not been identified. The present study quantitatively analyzed effects of estrogen administration on synaptic connections of neurons in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) of the retina. METHODS. Staining of Vesl-1L/Homer 1c (V-1L) immunoreactivity and TUNEL cytochemistry were used to quantify neuroprotective effects at the synaptic level in a model of mild retinal ischemia induced by temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion in the adult rat. RESULTS. V-1L immunoreactivity was found in both synaptic layers, postsynaptic to glutamatergic ribbon synapses. Mild retinal ischemia led to a significantly higher percentage reduction in the number of V-1L-positive synapses in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) compared with the percentage of TUNEL-positive apoptotic neurons in the GCL. Estrogen prevented ischemia-induced loss of V-1L-immunoreactive synapses in the IPL and apoptosis of cells in the GCL. CONCLUSIONS. Immunoreactivity for V-1L can be used as a synaptic marker for early changes before more severe neurodegenerative events. The present results suggest that estrogen protects neurons in the GCL including RGCs from both apoptosis and early changes in synaptic connections associated with ischemia and potentially preceding apoptosis.","['estrogen', '  metabotropic receptor', '  protein', '  animal cell', '  animal model', '  animal tissue', '  apoptosis', '  article', '  controlled study', '  electron microscopy', '  female', '  immunocytochemistry', '  immunoelectron microscopy', '  microscopy', '  nerve cell', '  neuroprotection', '  nick end labeling', '  nonhuman', '  priority journal', '  rat', '  retina ischemia', '  synapse', '  Animals', '  Apoptosis', '  Biological Markers', '  Carrier Proteins', '  Estrogens', '  Female', '  Fluorescent Antibody Technique', ' Indirect', '  In Situ Nick-End Labeling', '  Ischemia', '  Microscopy', ' Immunoelectron', '  Neurons', '  Neuropeptides', '  Neuroprotective Agents', '  Rats', '  Rats', ' Sprague-Dawley', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retinal Ganglion Cells', '  Retinal Vessels', '  Synapses']",70.0,,English,Article,"['Japan', ' Netherlands', ' United States']",[],['United States'],1994 - 2003,3

487,Role of phlebotomy in the management of hemoglobin SC disease: Case report and review of the literature,2003,American Journal of Hematology,"Marked variability is a keynote in the disease course of patients with hemoglobin SC (Hb SC) and hemoglobin S/β+-thalassemia (Hb S/β+-thal), with some patients having a frequency of complications and painful episodes similar to patients with homozygous sickle cell (Hb SS) disease. One possible explanation is that the higher hematocrit in these syndromes may contribute to an increase in blood viscosity, leading to vaso-occlusive pain episodes as well as an increased incidence of thromboembolic complications and retinopathy. We present a patient with Hb SC disease with an excellent baseline functional status who developed splenic infarction at a high altitude. Following splenectomy, the patient developed a sustained increase in hematocrit, an increase in the frequency of painful episodes, as well as new-onset dizziness and malaise. We initiated a therapeutic phlebotomy program in order to lower the hematocrit to pre-splenectomy values, as well as to induce iron deficiency. Repeated phlebotomy resulted in a dramatic decrease in symptoms. Our patient no longer requires narcotic analgesics for pain, has resolution of constitutional symptoms, and has not required further hospitalizations for vasoocclusive pain crises. The correlation between symptoms and hematocrit levels supports the importance of blood viscosity in contributing to this patient's symptoms. A trial of phlebotomy to reduce viscosity in patients with higher hematocrit values should be considered as an intervention for symptomatic patients with sickle cell disease. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","['narcotic analgesic agent', '  adult', '  altitude', '  article', '  blood vessel occlusion', '  blood viscosity', '  case report', '  fatigue', '  hematocrit', '  hemoglobin SC disease', '  human', '  iron deficiency', '  magnetic resonance angiography', '  malaise', '  male', '  nuclear magnetic resonance imaging', '  pain', '  phlebotomy', '  priority journal', '  spleen infarction', '  splenectomy', '  vertigo', '  Adult', '  Altitude', '  Dizziness', '  Hematocrit', '  Hemoglobin SC Disease', '  Humans', '  Infarction', '  Male', '  Pain', ' Postoperative', '  Phlebotomy', '  Retreatment', '  Spleen', '  Splenectomy']",25.0,,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],1994 - 2003,1
488,Retinopathy in sickle cell trait: Does it exist?,2003,Canadian Journal of Ophthalmology,"Background: Patients with sickle cell trait and concomitant systemic disease are known to be at risk for proliferative retinopathy, However, there are reports of retinopathy in patients with sickle cell trait without systemic disease. There are no population-based studies addressing the risk of sickle cell retinopathy in this group. We performed a study to clarify the relation between sickle cell trait and retinopathy in healthy subjects. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 100 children with sickle cell disease who attended the Sickle Cell Clinic at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto. We then contacted 200 parents with sickle cell trait, of whom 32 agreed to participate in the study. All participants were proven to have hemoglobin AS status with prior hemoglobin electrophoresis. An ophthalmologic history was obtained, and a complete ophthalmologic examination was performed. We defined sickle cell retinopathy as any salmon patch hemorrhages, iridescent spots, black sunbursts, retinal neovascularization or retinal detachment. The evaluation also included attempts to identify the more subtle signs of sickle cell retinopathy, such as optic nerve head vascular changes, vascular tortuosity, macular changes (e.g., microaneurysms and vascular loops) and peripheral arteriovenous anastamoses. Blood samples were obtained for complete blood count, reticulocyte count and smear. Results: We found no cases of sickle cell retinopathy among the 32 subjects. Ten of 30 subjects had a high reticulocyte count (greater than 120 × 109/L); however, there were no associated eye findings in this subgroup. Interpretation: Our results indicate that there is no increased risk of retinopathy in healthy people with sickle cell trait.","['adult', '  arteriovenous fistula', '  article', '  blood cell count', '  Canada', '  clinical article', '  female', '  human', '  male', '  optic nerve disease', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  reticulocyte count', '  retina detachment', '  retina neovascularization', '  sickle cell trait']",19.0,Elsevier B.V.,English,Article,"['Canada', ' United States', ' Canada']",[],"['Canada', 'Canada']",1994 - 2003,3

This approach is based on a spatial followed by a temporal characterization of retinal fluorescein angiographic images. The spatial characteristics (coordinates and classification number i.e. numbering of segments) are associated to bifurcation points (bp), which are matched in temporal image pairs for vessel segments correspondence forming. The matching process uses spatial and temporal characteristics between the bp and their surrounded vessel segments by computing a coefficient of similarity measurement. The recognition of vessel segments will help ophthalmologists in quantifying changes in vessel shape parameters and detect the temporal evolution of some retinal pathologies as the Sickle Cell retinopathy in our case. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

491,Mechanisms for sickle red blood cell retention in choroid,2002,Current Eye Research,"Purpose. Although sickle (SS) red cell-mediated vaso-occlusion in retina and resultant retinopathy is well documented, the effects of SS red cells on choroidal vasculature are poorly understood. The intent of this study was to determine, using a rat model, the conditions under which retention of sickle erythrocytes in choroid occur and if that retention can be inhibited. Methods. Sickle red cells were density separated into high density (SS4) or normal density, reticulocyte-enriched fractions (SS2). Red cells were labeled with FITC and administered IV to anesthetized Sprague Dawley rats. Rats were made either hypoxic or were given TNF-α intraperitoneally 5 hours before intravenous administration of red cells. Five minutes after administration of red cells, rats were exsanguinated, the retinas removed, and choroids prepared as flatmounts. The number of red cells retained in five high power fields of choroid was then determined. In other experiments, SS red cells were preincubated with the cyclic peptide TBC772 [inhibits binding of α4β1 (VLA-4) and α4β7 to their ligands], a control peptide TBC1194, or a VLA-4 neutralizing antibody before administration to the rat or antibodies against VLA-4 ligands were delivered IV before administration of SS red cells. Results. Hypoxic conditions before administration of SS red cells significantly stimulated retention of SS4 cells (P = 0.0003), but did not significantly increase retention of SS2 cells. Administration of TNF-α significantly increased retention of all types of SS red cells (P < 0.001). Preincubation of cells with anti-VLA-4 or TBC 772 inhibited retention of SS red cells in choriocapillaris of TNF-α-treated rats (P < 0.0001). Complete inhibition of cytokine-stimulated retention was also accomplished by IV administration of monoclonal antibodies against fibronectin or its CS-1 domain, a ligand for VLA-4. Conclusions. The mechanisms for retention of SS red cells in retina and choroid appear identical: hypoxia-mediated retention of dense red cells and adherence of red cells in reticulocyte-rich fractions after cytokine stimulation. TNF-α-stimulated retention of SS red cells in choroid appears to be mediated by VLA-4, presumably on the surface of some reticulocytes. This increased retention was inhibited by a VLA-4 antagonist (TBC772), a VLA-4 neutralizing antibody or by blocking one of VLA-4's ligands, the CS-1 portion of fibronectin.","['cyclopeptide', '  fluorescein isothiocyanate', '  monoclonal antibody', '  tbc 772', '  tumor necrosis factor alpha', '  unclassified drug', '  diagnostic agent', '  monoclonal antibody', '  tumor necrosis factor alpha', '  very late activation antigen 4', '  animal tissue', '  article', '  cell density', '  cell labeling', '  choroid', '  controlled study', '  human', '  human cell', '  hypoxia', '  male', '  nonhuman', '  priority journal', '  rat', '  retina', '  sickle cell', '  statistical significance', '  animal', '  anoxia', '  blood', '  cell adhesion', '  disease model', '  drug antagonism', '  drug effect', '  erythrocyte disorder', '  fluorescence microscopy', '  metabolism', '  retina blood vessel', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Sprague Dawley rat', '  vascular endothelium', '  vascularization', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Animals', '  Anoxia', '  Antibodies', ' Monoclonal', '  Cell Adhesion', '  Choroid', '  Disease Models', ' Animal', '  Endothelium', ' Vascular', '  Erythrocytes', ' Abnormal', '  Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', '  Humans', '  Integrin alpha4beta1', '  Male', '  Microscopy', ' Fluorescence', '  Rats', '  Rats', ' Sprague-Dawley', '  Retinal Vessels', '  Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",22.0,,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Institutes of Health, NIH, National Heart, Blood Institute, National Eye Institute, P30EY001765]",['United States'],1994 - 2003,1

Methods: Postmortem oculor tissue was obtained from five subjects (16, 21, 28, 40, and 41 years of age) with sickle haemoglobinopathies and from one control subject. Tissue was cryopreserved, and streptavidin peroxidase immunohistochemistry was performed with antibodies against ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and P-selectin. Immunohistochemical reaction product was scored, and PMN numbers were counted in sections stained with non-specific esterase. Results: Increased ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and P-selectin immunoreactivities were observed in sickle cell subjects compared to the control subject. The highest ICAM and P-selectin immunoreactivity was associated with intraretinal vessels adjacent to the preretinal neovascular formation in subjects with proliferative retinopathy. This was not the case with VCAM-1 immunoreactivity, which was highest in intraretinal vessels adjacent to the sea fan when the sea fan was still ""in statu nascendi."" Fully formed, ""older"" sea fans had the highest levels of VCAM-1. The increase in adhesion molecule immunoreactivity was paralleled by an increase in intraretinal PMNs. The number of intraretinal PMNs increased with progression of the disease and the numbers surpassed those in control subjects by threefold. In the sea fan with the greatest VCAM-1 immunoreactivity, there were 20 times more PMNs were observed than in the rest of the retina in the same subject.

497,When should children and young adults with sickle cell disease be referred for eye assessment?,2001,African journal of medicine and medical sciences,"Children and young adults who suffer from sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk of blindness from retinopathy and other complications. The incidence of proliferative retinopathy in SCD patients varies from 5 to 10% depending on the genotype, being commoner in SC than SS and S-thal. 'Sudden' blinding sequelae such as vitreous haemmorrhage and tractional retinal detachment can eventuate from vasculo-proliferative retinal lesions, known as sea fans, in otherwise 'quiet' eyes. This risk can be minimised considerably if the lesions are detected in a timely fashion and treated, usually with laser photocoagulation and possibly with cryotherapy. This communication aims, by a review of relevant literature and through our original data, to highlight a time frame for the development of proliferative sickle retinopathy to enable paediatricians decide on an appropriate time of referral for ophthalmic assessment. Ninety patients with SCD (88 SS, 2 SC) aged 5-36 years were examined for anterior and posterior ocular signs of SCD using dilated binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy. Other relevant literature was reviewed. Twenty-four percent of these patients had some form of SCD related posterior pathology, 5.6% of which was pre-proliferative or proliferative. This included a 14-year-old SS patient with arterio-venous anastomosis. The literature reveals that patients begin to exhibit evidence of proliferative retinopathy from about the age of 10 and the frequency tends to increase with age. However, though rare, vitreous haemmorhage has been known to occur below the age of 20. Children with SCD should, from about the age of ten, be referred for at least biennial dilated binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy preferably with fluorescein angiography if such facilities are available, so that neovascular lesions can be treated before blinding sequelae occur. From the age of 20, the frequency of eye examination should increase to yearly. Antisickling remedies, such as NIPRISAN may be beneficial in prophylaxis.","['adolescent', '  adult', '  article', '  child', '  female', '  human', '  male', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  pathology', '  patient referral', '  peripheral occlusive artery disease', '  preschool child', '  retina', '  retina blood vessel', '  retina disease', '  retina hemorrhage', '  sickle cell anemia', '  vitreous body', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Arterial Occlusive Diseases', '  Child', '  Child', ' Preschool', '  Female', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Ophthalmoscopy', '  Referral and Consultation', '  Retina', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retinal Hemorrhage', '  Retinal Vessels', '  Vitreous Body']",16.0,,English,Article,"['Niger', ' Nigeria']",[],[],1994 - 2003,2

Method: Case Report. A 20-year-old man with unilateral Stage 3 sickle retinopathy associated with an ischaemic ridge presenting three years after the initial mild blunt ocular trauma. Results: Fundus examination of the left eye showed an ischaemic ridge delineating avascular from vascular retina. Fluorescein angiography of the left eye showed an avascular peripheral retina and multiple sea fan neovascularization. Blood studies showed him to be Hb AS. Conclusions: In our patient the proliferative changes were the result of his initial mild trauma associated with an increase in the intraocular pressure.

501,Renal disease in the inner city,2001,Seminars in Nephrology,"For various ethnic and socioeconomic reasons the pattern of renal disease in the inner city displays distinctive features. Hypertension is frequent, often intractable, and generally conditioned by salt sensitivity and a high sodium intake. Chronic hypertensive nephrosclerosis, found predominantly in African Americans, comprises marked cardiomegaly, renal shrinkage, and hypertensive retinopathy. It has been overdiagnosed in the past, but actually accounts for less than 20% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in African Americans. Malignant hypertension, less frequent nowadays, may cause renal shutdown, which is reversible in a few cases; the heart and kidneys are often of normal size. Idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is the most common cause of the primary nephrotic syndrome in blacks, but its incidence has also been rising in whites and Hispanics; it does not respond well to treatment, and almost one half of the patients develop ESRD within 10 years. Systemic lupus erythematosus is also more common in African Americans, in whom the severe proliferative forms of lupus nephritis pursue a more virulent course: one half of such patients develop ESRD in 5 years. Cocaine, the use of which has assumed epidemic proportions, may cause accelerated hypertension, acute renal failure from rhabdomyolysis, and progression of preexisting renal disease. Heroin nephropathy has all but disappeared and has been replaced by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) nephropathy. The prognosis of HIV-infected patients maintained by dialysis has greatly improved. Sickle glomerulopathy, consisting of mesangial expansion, basement membrane duplication, and the absence of immune deposits, may cause the nephrotic syndrome in 4% of patients with severe sickle cell anemia, heralding death within 2 years in one half of patients and ESRD in two thirds; survival has not improved with dialysis. Diabetes is now the most common cause of ESRD. Familial aggregation of ESRD is frequently encountered. Interventions useful in the general population, such as vascular bypass procedures, should be undertaken with great caution and restraint in dialysis patients. Copyright © 2001 W.B.

503,Significant reduction of the panretinal oxygenation response after 28% supplemental oxygen recovery in experimental ROP,2000,Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science,"PURPOSE. To test the hypothesis that after supplemental oxygen recovery (SOR) in the newborn rat model of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) the preretinal neovascular (NV) incidence and severity are decreased and the panretinal oxygenation ability is improved. METHODS. Newborn rats were first raised in either room air (controls) or variable oxygen (50%/10%) for 14 days. The experimental rats were recovered during the next 6 days (until day 20) in either room air (21% O2) or supplemental oxygen (28%). All groups were then expoosed to room air for an additional 6 days (until day 26). On day 20, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to determine the panretinal oxygenation response (ΔPo2, mm Hg) to a carbogen (95% O2/5% CO2) inhalation challenge. On days 20 and 26, the retinas from a different subset of control, room air-recovered, or SOR-recovered animals were analyzed using ADPase stained or fluorescein-labeled dextran infused retinal flatmounts. RESULTS. On day 20, the panretinal ΔPo2 of the room air-recovered group (125 ±-5 mm Hg, mean ± SEM, n = 12) was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower than that of the control group (179 ± 6 mm Hg, n = 11). The panretinal ΔPo2 value for the SOR group (87 ± 5 mm Hg, n = 7) was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower than both the room air-recovered group and the control group. The NV incidence and severity were significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05) in the SOR animals compared with the room air-recovered animals. In contrast, on day 26 (after 6 days in air), the NV incidence was statistically (P &lt; 0.05) greater in the animals that had been exposed to SOR compared with room air-recovered animals. CONCLUSIONS. After 28% SOR, the expected decrease in NV incidence and severity occurred but with an unexpected decrease in panretinal oxygenation ability. The present data strongly support an association between subnormal panretinal oxygenation ability and increased NV risk in the newborn rat ROP model. MRI appears to be a powerful new approach for quantitatively and noninvasively measuring retinal oxygenation and may be applicable to study other ischemic or ischemia-related retinopathies in addition to ROP, such as diabetic retinopathy, sickle cell-retinopathy, macular degeneration, and glaucoma.","['carbogen', '  oxygen', '  animal experiment', '  animal model', '  animal tissue', '  article', '  controlled study', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  glaucoma', '  newborn', '  nonhuman', '  nuclear magnetic resonance imaging', '  oxygen therapy', '  priority journal', '  rat', '  retina macula degeneration', '  retina neovascularization', '  retinopathy', '  retrolental fibroplasia', '  sickle cell anemia', '  tissue oxygenation', '  Animals', '  Animals', ' Newborn', '  Carbon Dioxide', '  Female', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Humans', '  Hyperoxia', '  Infant', ' Newborn', '  Magnetic Resonance Imaging', '  Oxygen', '  Oxygen Consumption', '  Rats', '  Rats', ' Sprague-Dawley', '  Retina', '  Retinal Neovascularization', '  Retinopathy of Prematurity']",32.0,,English,Article,['United States'],[National Eye Institute],['United States'],1994 - 2003,1

510,Sickle cell anemia as a possible state of enhanced anti-apoptotic tone: Survival effect of vascular endothelial growth factor on circulating and unanchored endothelial cells,1999,Blood,"The biologic processes of apoptosis and angiogenesis are linked in endothelial biology because some endothelial cell growth factors also exert anti-apoptotic effects. We studied whether apoptosis is occurring in circulating endothelial cells (CEC) that have lost the survival signals derived from anchorage to extracellular matrix. Consistent with this expectation, 64% ± 16% of CEC from normal donors showed evidence of apoptosis (by morphology and TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling [TUNEL] assay). However, only 30% ± 15% (P &lt; .001 v normal) of CEC from donors with sickle cell anemia were apoptotic. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were significantly (P = .001) higher in plasma of sickle donors (120.1 ± 81.4 pg/mL) than that of normal donors (37.6 ± 34.6 pg/mL), and there was an inverse correlation between VEGF and CEC apoptosis (r = .612, P = .001). Consistent with stimulation by VEGF, CEC from sickle donors exhibited increased expression of {v)β3. In vitro experiments showed that VEGF inhibits apoptosis for cultured endothelial cells that are kept unanchored end not allowed to re-establish attachment to extracellular matrix, thus demonstrating that VEGF provides survival signals independent of its ability to promote matrix reattachment. These data suggest the hypothesis that sickle cell anemia is a state of enhanced anti-apoptotic tone for endothelial cells. If true, this has implications for disease pathobiology, particularly the development of neovascularizing retinopathy.","['angiogenesis', '  apoptosis', '  article', '  cell survival', '  clinical article', '  human', '  human cell', '  priority journal', '  retina neovascularization', '  sickle cell anemia', '  vascular endothelium']",110.0,W.B.

The diagnosis of Hb S/O(Arab) requires electrophoresis on both cellulose acetate and citrate agar, since Hb O (Arab) co-migrates with Hb C at alkaline pH and close to Hb S at acidic pH. To date only case reports and small series of patients with Hb S/O)Arab) have been described. To better characterize the clinical and laboratory aspects of this unusual disorder, we reviewed the Duke University Medical Center experience. We identified 13 African-American children and adults with Hb S/O(Arab) ranging in age from 2.7 to 62.5 years. All patients had hemolytic anemia with a median Hb of 8.7 gm/dL (range 6.1- 9.9 gm/dL), and a median reticulocyte count of 5.8% (range 1.2-10.3%). The peripheral blood smear typically showed sickled erythrocytes, target cells, polychromasia, and nucleated red blood cells. All 13 patients have had significant clinical sickling events including acute chest syndrome (11), recurrent vasoocclusive painful events (10), dactylitis (7), gallstones (5), nephropathy (4), aplastic crises (2), avascular necrosis (2), leg ulcers (2), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) (1), osteomyelitis (1), and retinopathy (1). Four patients have died, including two from pneumococcal sepsis/meningitis at ages 5 and 10 years, one of acute chest syndrome at age 47 years, and one of multiorgan failure at age 35 years.

513,Angiogenic factors in human proliferative sickle cell retinopathy,1999,British Journal of Ophthalmology,"Background/aims - Preretinal neovascular formations called sea fans develop at the border of non-perfused peripheral retina in sickle cell retinopathy. Angiogenic factors which could contribute to their development, however, have not been examined previously. The objective of this study was to determine immunohistochemically if vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were associated with sea fan formations. Methods - Immunohistochemistry on cryosections was used to localise bFGF, VEGF, heparan sulphate proteoglycan, human serum albumin, collagens IV and II, and von Willebrand factor in tissue from five sickle cell and one control subject. Results - The greatest immunoreactivity for VEGF and bFGF was in the feeder and preretinal vessels of sea fans (p < O.01). The most prominent reaction product was localised to vascular endothelial cells. In retinal vessels, VEGF and bFGF immunereactivities were greater in sickle cell subjects (both proliferative and nonproliferative) than in the control subject (p < 0.01 and p < 0.02 respectively). In the sickle cell retina, no angiogenic factor immunoreactivity was detected in nonperfused periphery and there was no significant difference in bFGF or VEGF immunoreactivity between perfused retina and the border of perfused and non-perfused areas. Conclusion - Our results demonstrate for the first time that VEGF and bFGF are associated with sea fan formations in sickle cell retinopathy. Both factors may function in an autocrine manner because immunoreactivity for these factors was greater within the neovascularisation than in adjacent retina.","['angiogenic factor', '  basic fibroblast growth factor', '  collagen type 2', '  collagen type 4', '  heparan sulfate', '  human serum albumin', '  proteoglycan', '  vasculotropin', '  von Willebrand factor', '  adult', '  article', '  clinical article', '  controlled study', '  female', '  human', '  human tissue', '  immunohistochemistry', '  male', '  priority journal', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  retina blood vessel', '  sickle cell anemia', '  vascular endothelium']",50.0,BMJ Publishing Group,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Heart, Blood Institute, National Eye Institute, P30EY001765]",['United States'],1994 - 2003,1
514,Ocular neovascularization: An epidemiologic review,1998,Survey of Ophthalmology,"Neovascularization occurs in many eye diseases, and its epidemiologic impact is significant. However, data on the prevalence and incidence of ocular neovascularization have never been compiled to demonstrate its pervasiveness. This overview of ocular angiogenesis provides a review of the epidemiologic literature for neovascularization in various parts of the eye, including the cornea, iris, retina, and choroid. Relevant disease states are reviewed, as are their risk factors, so that their pathogenesis can be better understood. Data on the prevalence and incidence of the major diseases involving angiogenesis are synthesized to provide statistical evidence of the span and magnitude of ocular neovascularization. These prevalence and incidence data on ocular neovascularization are extrapolated to USA population data where possible, and 'worst-case' estimates are calculated as well. Information was gathered with a search of the MEDLINE database, published monographs and volumes, and consultation with a number of primary authors.

515,Nonperfusion of retina and choroid in transgenic mouse models of sickle cell disease,1998,Current Eye Research,"Purpose. To determine if vascular occlusion and nonperfusion is associated with the outer retinal atrophy, retinopathy, and choroidopathy (chorioretinopathy) that occurs in the α(H)β(S)[β(MDV)] and α(H)β(S)[α(MD)β(MDD)] transgenic mouse models of sickle cell disease. Methods. Mice from the α(H)β(S)[β(MDD)] and α(H)β(S)[α(MD)β(MDD)] transgenic mouse lines that express high levels of human β5 globin were anesthetized and administered horseradish peroxidase (HRP) intracardially. After 1 min, the animals were sacrificed, and the retina from one eye was excised, fixed, and developed in diaminobenzidine (DAB). The contralateral eye was fixed, embedded whole in glycol methacrylate, and HRP developed in 2.5 μm sections. Results. HRP reaction product (HRP-RP) and stained erythrocytes (RBCs) (due to endogenous peroxidase) were diffusely distributed within all vascular lumens in flatmount retinas from control animals (littermates homozygous for the mouse β(Major) deletion not expressing the β5 transgene). In 42.5% of the transgenic mice expressing β5 without any proliferative retinopathy, many blood vessels contained RBC plugs and lacked lumenal HRP-RP. In addition to packed RBCs, fibrin was sometimes present at sites of occlusion. In sections from whole eyes of the same animals, foci of photoreceptor degeneration were associated with areas of choriocapillaris nonperfusion (lumen that lacked HRP-PR). In areas with normal photoreceptors, the choriocapillaris appeared perfused (HRP-RP was present). In animals with proliferative chorioretinopathy, some neovascular formations lacked luminal HRP-RP, suggesting autoinfarction. Conclusions. Nonperfused retinal and choroidal vessels were observed in mice from the α(H)β(S)[β(MDD)] and (α(H)β(S)[α(MD)β(MDD)] lines without retinal and choroidal neovascularization. whereas, all mice with neovascularization had nonperfused areas. Furthermore, small foci of PR loss were associated with areas of nonperfused choriocapillaris. These results suggest that sickle cell-mediated vaso-occlusions are an initial event in the chorioretinopathy and outer retinal atrophy that occurs in these models.","['2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate', '  beta globin', '  diaminobenzidine', '  fibrin', '  horseradish peroxidase', '  animal experiment', '  animal model', '  animal tissue', '  article', '  blood vessel occlusion', '  chorioretinopathy', '  choroid', '  choroid capillary layer', '  choroid disease', '  controlled study', '  erythrocyte', '  mouse', '  nonhuman', '  priority journal', '  retina', '  retina blood vessel', '  retina blood vessel occlusion', '  retina neovascularization', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  subretinal neovascularization', '  tissue perfusion', '  transgenic mouse']",10.0,Informa Healthcare,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Heart, Blood Institute, National Eye Institute, P30EY001765]",['United States'],1994 - 2003,1

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a pivotal role in the new vessel formation in different ocular diseases including diabetic retinopathy. In this study, we examined the relationship between intravitreal levels of VEGF and various types of vascular retJnopathies. Methods. We obtained vitreous samples from patients undergoing vitreous surgery using established technique. 50 specimens of vitreous fluid were obtained from patients with conditions such as diabetes, central retinal vein occlusion, sickle cell retinopathy, uveitis and epimacular membranes. The concentrations of VEGF were measured using ELISA . As for the clinical data grades of retinopathy, duration of diabetes, state of blood glucose levels and other relevant clinical history were investigated. The VEGF concentrations and the above clinical data were correlated. Results. VEGF was detected in 36 of the 50 specimens. The mean VEGF concentration in patients with active vascular proliferative rctinopathies was 5.72 ng/ml, which was significantly higher than those conditions that did not have active vasculopathy such as uveitis and epimacular membranes (0.04 and 1.05 ng/ml respectively).The VEGF concentration was also elevated in the patients with preproliferative diabetes, which suggests that increased levels of VEGF may contribute to progression of retinopathy to proliferative stage. Conclusions. VEGF levels were consistently higher in vitreous cavity of patients with active retinal neovascularization irrespective of etiology.",,0.0,,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],1994 - 2003,1

Complications due to abnormal ocular neovascularization remain the leading cause of visual loss throughout the world today. Neovascularization and the associated increase in vascular permeability are the underlying threats to vision in such diverse conditions as diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, retinopathy of prematurity, exudative age-related macular degeneration, sickle cell retinopathy, radiation retinopathy, and numerous others. Although it has been appreciated for nearly one-half century that the clinical findings associated with ocular neovascularization suggest an etiology involving the elaboration of growth factors, the exact molecules involved and their mechanisms of action have remained incompletely understood.

Changes in retinal blood flow may provide important information for clinical decision-making in several populations, including those with diabetic retinopathy, sickle cell disease and retinitis pigmentosa. Normal volunteer subjects were studied before and after oxygen breathing After IV injection, relative fluorescence was obtained using scanning laser ophthalmoscopy/image processing in all vessel branches (average, 17). For each experiment, 64 frames (2/s) were digitized and were normalized using the RTD method. Vessel diameters were measured using densitometry techniques on fundus photos, where the diameter data made it possible to weight each vessel according to relative cross-sectional area to obtain a true mean circulation time (MCT). MCT increased for the group of subjects when breathing oxygen compared to normal air (P=0.001), representing a decrease in retinal blood flow. Average MCT increased 2.82±2.51 s for all subjects, with an increase of 2.93±2.26 s in repeat trials for one subject. the proposed method uses information from all retinal vessels and allows the assessment of overall, as well as selected, regional retinal flow. It is more comprehensive than previous methods analysing single vessel flow. This method will be potentially useful for assessing hemodynamic changes in the retina associated with a wide range of eye disease.This study validates the use of residence time distribution (RTD) functions in human subjects to assess changes in retinal flow by using the widely recognized model of flow changes due to oxygen breathing.

525,Histopathologic features of neovascularization in sickle cell retinopathy,1997,American Journal of Ophthalmology,"PURPOSE: To examine the histopathologic and morphometric features of neovascular lesions in human proliferative sickle cell retinopathy. METHODS: Postmortem ocular tissue was obtained from three subjects (aged 20, 28, and 40 years) with SS hemoglobinopathy and prepared for adenosine diphosphatase flat-embedding. Morphometric analysis was performed before serial sectioning. RESULTS: Numerous active and autoinfarcted lesions were found that represented virtually all stages in the life cycle of preretinal neovascularization. These formations ranged from single small loops extending from arteries and veins along the retinal surface to the typical complex, elevated sea fan formations. Sea fans developed at hairpin loops and at arteriovenous crossings. There was an average of 5.6 connections between sea fans and retinal vessels; of these, 45% were arteriolar, 52.5% were venular, and 2.6% were at the capillary level. Six of eight sea fans were located at arteriovenous crossings. Autoinfarction appeared to occur initially within the sea fan capillaries. The average height of sea fans was 123 μm above the retinal surface. CONCLUSIONS: Preretinal neovascularization in sickle cell retinopathy can arise from both the arterial and venous sides of the retinal vasculature and can assume a variety of morphologic configurations. Multiple feeding arterioles and draining venules are common, and autoinfarction appears to occur initially at the preretinal capillary level rather than at feeding arterioles. Arteriovenous crossings may be a preferential site for sea fan development.","['angiogenesis', '  article', '  blood viscosity', '  cell proliferation', '  hemoglobinopathy', '  histopathology', '  human', '  human tissue', '  life cycle', '  microcirculation', '  point mutation', '  priority journal', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  vascularization']",46.0,Elsevier Inc.,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Institutes of Health, NIH, National Heart, Blood Institute, National Eye Institute, P30EY001765, RPB]",['United States'],1994 - 2003,1
526,Vitreous hemorrhage,1997,Survey of Ophthalmology,"The incidence of spontaneous vitreous hemorrhage is approximately 7 cases per 100,000 population. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (32%), retinal tear (30%) proliferative retinopathy after retinal vein occlusion (11%) and posterior vitreous detachment without retinal tear (8%) are the most common causes of spontaneous vitreous hemorrhage. Vitreous hemorrhage can be caused by the pathologic mechanisms of disruption of normal retinal vessels, bleeding from diseased retinal vessels or abnormal new vessels, and extension of hemorrhage through the retina from other sources. Hemorrhage into the vitreous gel results in rapid clot formation and is followed by slow clearance of approximately 1% per day. The cellular response to vitreous hemorrhage is unusual with regard to hemorrhage in any tissue outside the vitreous cavity and has been compared to a 'low-turnover' granuloma. Unique clinicopathologic features of long-standing vitreous hemorrhage include cholesterolosis bulbi (synchysis scintillans), hemoglobin spherulosis, and vitreous cylinders. Complications of nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage are hemosiderosis bulbi and glaucoma: Ghost cell glaucoma, hemolytic glaucoma, and hemosiderotic glaucoma may result from vitreous hemorrhage. The established treatment option for nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage is pars plana vitrectomy. Experimental nonsurgical treatment options involve improvement of physiologic clearance mechanisms in order to accelerate fibrinolysis, liquefaction, hemolysis, and phagocytosis.","['hyaluronidase', '  plasmin', '  plasminogen activator', '  rhesus antibody', '  spider venom antiserum', '  streptodornase', '  streptokinase', '  surfactant', '  tranexamic acid', '  trypsin', '  urea', '  urokinase', '  ciliary disk', '  clinical article', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  eye injury', '  fibrin clot', '  glaucoma', '  human', '  hypopyon', '  phagocytosis', '  priority journal', '  prognosis', '  retina tear', '  review', '  siderosis', '  vitrectomy', '  vitreous body detachment', '  vitreous hemorrhage']",180.0,Elsevier USA,English,Review,['United States'],[],['United States'],1994 - 2003,1
527,Is Hb A2 elevated in adults with sickle-α-thalassemia (β(s)/β(s);- α/-α)?,1997,Hemoglobin,"Thirteen patients with sickle cell anemia (SS) were found to have two a gene deletions with a presumptive genotype of β(s)/β(s); -α/-α. Hematological data showed that this group of patients had elevated Hb A2 level. In order to determine whether the elevation of Hb A2 is typical of SS with a two α gene deletion or is due to undiagnosed S-β(o)-thalassemia with a two a gene deletion we looked for the presence or absence of β(o)- thalassemia by molecular techniques. The latter included reverse dot-blot hybridization to rule out a β-thalassemia mutation, digestion with Cvnl endonuclease followed by Southern blotting and hybridization with a β genomic probe, and, in selected patients, determination of the synthetic α/β ratio. One of the 13 patients had S-β(o)-thalassemia with a G→A mutation at IVS-II-1 indicating that her genotype was β(s/β(o) thalassemia; -α/-α. The remaining 12 patients were homozygous for the sickle gene, had relatively elevated Hb levels, increased Hb A2 values, and Hb F levels similar to those in patients with SS and four or three α genes. At the clinical level, the 12 patients with SS and a two α gene deletion had increased prevalence of avascular necrosis, retinopathy, and splenomegaly, but decreased prevalence of leg ulcers and cerebrovascular accidents. Together, the data indicate that SS with a two α gene deletion (β(s)/β(s); -α/-α is a unique subset of patients with SS characterized by distinct hematological and clinical features.","['hemoglobin A2', '  hemoglobin A2', '  adult', '  alpha thalassemia', '  article', '  clinical article', '  dot hybridization', '  female', '  gene deletion', '  gene mutation', '  genotype', '  hemoglobin determination', '  homozygosity', '  human', '  male', '  molecular genetics', '  sickle cell anemia', '  blood', '  clinical trial', '  genetics', '  metabolism', '  middle aged', '  Adult', '  alpha-Thalassemia', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Female', '  Gene Deletion', '  Hemoglobin A2', '  Humans', '  Male', '  Middle Aged']",13.0,Informa Healthcare,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Heart, Blood Institute]",['United States'],1994 - 2003,1

530,A rat model for sickle cell-mediated vaso-occlusion in retina,1996,Microvascular Research,"Occlusions of the retinal vasculature are the initiating event in sickle cell retinopathy. In order to understand the mechanism(s) of sickle cell-mediated occlusion, a rat model was developed. Red blood cells (RBCs) from patients homozygous for hemoglobin (Hb) S (SS) or double heterozygous for Hb S and Hb C (SC) were separated on Percoll-Larex continuous density gradients, labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (LITC), and delivered via the left ventricle to anesthetized, ventilated rats. Blood gas levels were altered by changing inspired gas and monitored via a femoral arterial catheter. After the RBCs circulated for 5 min, animals were perfused with heparinized saline, the eyes enucleated, and the retinas removed and processed by our ADPase flatmount technique. The retinal vasculature was visualized under dark-field illumination and the LITC-RBCs visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Greater numbers of high-density SS cells (SS4, which consist of dense, dehydrated discocytes and irreversible sickled cells) were retained in the normal rat retinal vasculature than normal-density SS cells (SS2, which have the same density as normal AA cells, but consist of reticulocytes and young cells). Retention of SS4 cells was inversely dependent on the arterial oxygen tension. Most SS4s were retained in capillaries, but a few were observed within precapillary arterioles. The retained RBCs occupied the full lumenal diameter of vessels in most cases. In contrast, very few RBCs from SC donors (normal or high density) were retained in the normal retinal vasculature and retention did not increase significantly with hypoxia. This model demonstrates that high-density SS cells, which include irreversibly sickled cells, are retained in normal rat retinal vessels and that the number retained is oxygen dependent. Furthermore, it appears that trapping, not adhesion, is responsible for retention of RBCs in the normal retinal vasculature because there was preferential retention of SS4 cells, which are known to have lower adherence propensity, and the retained RBCs blocked the full diameter of the vessel. These results also demonstrate that the mechanism of vascular obstruction by SS and SC RBCs is different because low retention of SC cells was observed. The well-known propensity of SC patients to have retinal abnormalities must involve extra erythrocytic factors like increased hematocrit, induction of adhesive molecules and integrins, etc.","['animal experiment', '  animal model', '  article', '  blood gas analysis', '  hypoxia', '  male', '  microcirculation', '  nonhuman', '  priority journal', '  retina vein occlusion', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Animalia', '  Larex']",19.0,Academic Press Inc.,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Institutes of Health, NIH, National Heart, Blood Institute, National Eye Institute, P30EY001765]",['United States'],1994 - 2003,1
531,Determinants of haemoglobin level in steady-state homozygous sickle cell disease,1996,British Journal of Haematology,"High total haemoglobin levels in homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease are a risk factor for painful crises, avascular necrosis of the femoral head, proliferative sickle retinopathy, and the acute chest; syndrome. Since lowering the haemoglobin level may ameliorate these features, understanding the determinants of total haemoglobin may be of practical importance. A range of possible determinants including red cell characteristics, reticulocytes, serum iron, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, alpha thalassaemia status, red cell mass and plasma volume, oxygen affinity, red cell survival, transferrin receptor and erythropoietin levels have been measured in 62 patients selected to provide a range of total haemoglobin and fetal haemoglobin levels. There were weak negative associations of haemoglobin with mean cell volume and mean cell haemoglobin concentration, strong negative associations with proportional reticulocyte counts, oxygen affinity, plasma volume, serum transferrin receptors, and erythropoietin levels and strong positive associations with red cell mass. Weighted analysis suggested that the statistically independent determinants of haemoglobin level were alpha thalassaemia, sex, red cell mass/body weight, plasma volume/body weight, fetal haemoglobin and red cell count. The apparent contributions of red cell survival, P50, reticulocyte count, serum transferrin receptor and erythropoietin levels were explained by the effects of these other variables. The independent determinants as a group explained 91% of the variation in haemoglobin level.","['adult', '  article', '  female', '  hemoglobin blood level', '  hemolysis', '  homozygosity', '  human', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  priority journal', '  sickle cell anemia']",42.0,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,English,Article,"['United Kingdom', ' Jamaica', ' United States']",[],['Jamaica'],1994 - 2003,3

Methods: The authors discuss the Ophthalmologie evaluation and clinical course of a 49-year-old woman with sickle cell trait and rheumatoid arthritis who presented with a cilioretinal artery occlusion. Results: The patient’s laboratory evaluation showed both a high rheumatoid factor titer and a mild hypergammaglobulinemia, causing increased serum viscosity. The high level of sickle hemoglobin—42.3% (range in trait, 22%–46%)—increased serum viscosity, and lower cilioretinal artery perfusion pressure relative to the central retinal artery resulted in cilioretinal artery occlusion. Conclusions: Isolated cilioretinal artery occlusions carry a good prognosis, and this patient recovered 20/20 Visual acuity in the affected eye.

The purpose of this study was (1) to compare macular blood flow velocity in patients with sickle cell disease and controls, and (2) to determine in sickle cell patients the relation between macular blood flow velocity and red blood cell density. Methods-Macular blood flow velocity was measured in 18 patients with stable sickle cell disease and 45 normal controls using blue field entoptoscopy. Red blood cell density was determined by the phthalate ester density method. Results-There were no significant differences between patients and controls for leucocyte velocity. However, in the sickle cell patients leucocyte velocity in the macular capillaries was significantly negatively associated with greater range of red blood cell density (p<0.002 and p<0.4 for right and left eyes, respectively). Conclusion-These results suggest that in sickle cell patients heterogeneity of the density of the red blood cells may slow down macular capillary blood flow.","['phthalic acid ester', '  adult', '  article', '  blood flow velocity', '  cell density', '  clinical article', '  controlled study', '  erythrocyte', '  female', '  human', '  male', '  pathogenesis', '  priority journal', '  retina blood flow', '  retina capillary', '  retina macula lutea', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Blood Flow Velocity', '  Cell Movement', '  Erythrocyte Count', '  Female', '  Human', '  Leukocytes', '  Macula Lutea', '  Male']",11.0,BMJ Publishing Group,English,Article,"['Jersey', ' United States']",[],['United States'],1994 - 2003,2

The FAZ enlarges in vaso-occlusive diseases, especially diabetic retinopathy, sickle cell retinopathy, talc retinopathy and branch retinal vein occlusion. In the present study the FAZ of 20 patients affected by macular branch retinal vein occlusion (MBRVO) was compared with the FAZ of 41 control subjects. The FAZ mean area was 0.56 ± 0.34 mm2 SD in the MBRVO group, while 0.26 ± 0.07 mm2 SD in the control group, with a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.001).

Taking into account the MBRVO group, a statistical correlation was found between visual acuity impairment and FAZ enlargement (p = 0.02), but not between visual acuity impairment and macular edema (p = 0.41). In 14 cases (70%) secondary avascular microzones located in the macular sector correspondent to MBRVO were also evident.

Methods-Retinal examination and fluorescein angiography were performed in 61 patients with SS disease (40 eastern, 20 south western, 1 central region) and 10 with sickle cell ,β0 thalassaemia. Results-Peripheral retinal vascular changes were common, and a qualitatively abnormal vascular border believed to imply risk of proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR) was significantly more common in south western SS patients and PSR was shown in one of these. There were no differences in visual acuity, the presence of peripheral retinal patches, or the circumferential or posterior extent of peripheral retinal vessel closure between SS disease and sickle cell β0 thalassaemia or between SS disease in the two regions. Compared with the Jamaican Cohort Study, &gt;180° of the peripheral retinal vasculature was seen significantly less frequent, suggesting factors inhibiting vascular remodelling in Saudi patients in early life.

The fellow eye from each animal was embedded whole in glycol methacrylate for histopathological analysis of all ocular structures. Retinal vascular occlusions resulted in nonperfused areas of retina and arterio- venous anastomoses. Intra- and extraretinal neovascularization was observed adjacent to nonperfused areas. Retinal pigmented lesions were formed by the migration of retinal pigment epithelial cells into sensory retina, often ensheathing choroidal neovascularization. The incidence of this bilateral chorioretinopathy was 30% in animals older than 15 months of age.

The incidence of grade II retinopathy was found to be significantly higher than grade I in SC disease. This concurs with the results of the Jamaican screening and confirms that these patients are at higher risk of visual impairment than those with SS disease. Our results also agree with the Jamaican experience which suggest that visual morbidity is mostly due to complications of proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR). However, the findings in patients without proliferative changes are different; in particular, angioid streaks leading to disciforms are an important cause of visual loss in Jamaica, but were not seen in any of the 98 eyes examined in this study. No correlation was found between the grade of retinopathy and age, sex, systemic complications and various haematological parameters except for the percentage of haemoglobin F, which was significantly higher in patients with grade I (7.6) compared with grade II (4.2) retinopathy (p = 0.0127). © 1994, The Ophthalmological Society of the United Kingdom.

Symptoms of pallor, fever, abdominal and joint pain, and swelling of the liver, spleen, hands and feet first appear near the latter part of the first year of life. Intravascular sickling affects all organs. For clinical and therapeutic purposes, exacerbations may be classified as vaso-occlusive or pain, aplastic, hemolytic or sequestration crisis. In addition to infection, complications include severe pain, cerebrovascular accidents, cholelithiasis, bone infarction, heart failure, hypotension and priapism. The most common cause of early childhood death is septicemia or meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Complications may be reduced or prevented by early diagnosis through newborn screening, patient education, routine immunizations, administration of folic acid, pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations, penicillin prophylaxis, and early diagnosis and aggressive treatment of complications.","['aminoglycoside antibiotic agent', '  ampicillin', '  cephalosporin derivative', '  chloramphenicol', '  cotrimoxazole', '  deferoxamine', '  erythromycin', '  hemoglobin a', '  hemoglobin c', '  hemoglobin f', '  hemoglobin s', '  influenza vaccine', '  morphine', '  penicillin derivative', '  pethidine', '  pneumococcus vaccine', '  sulfamethoxazole', '  trimethoprim', '  analgesia', '  antibiotic prophylaxis', '  bacterial infection', '  clinical feature', '  disease classification', '  exchange blood transfusion', '  fat embolism', '  fever', '  human', '  immunization', '  leg ulcer', '  osteomyelitis', '  pain', '  pregnancy', '  priapism', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  review', '  sickle cell anemia', '  stroke', '  urinary tract infection', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Human']",18.0,,English,Review,['United States'],[],['United States'],1994 - 2003,1
552,Immunohistochemical insights into sickle cell retinopathy,1994,Current Eye Research,"Dynamic vaso-occlusive and vaso-proliferative events occur in sickle cell retinopathy. Using streptavidin peroxidase immuno-histochemistry, we investigated changes in distribution and relative levels of components in the fibrinolytic system and growth factors in retina and choroid from 2 sickle cell patients: a 20 month old SS patient and a 54 year old SC patient. Antigen localization in the sickle cell patients was compared to localization from 2 non-sickle cell, non-diabetic control subjects. In chorioretinal pigmented lesions of the SC patient, bFGF and TGF-β1, β2, and β3 immunoreactivity was present within migrating retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Our interpretation of the data presented in this case study is that fibrin deposition within retinal and choroidal vessels of sickle cell subjects may occur due to elevated PAI-1 activity. Moreover, vaso-occlusions of choroidal vessels may influence the expression of growth factors in choriocapillaris endothelium, which could stimulate formation of choroidal neovascularization. Finally, fibrosis and gliosis in and near chorioretinal pigmented lesions may be stimulated by RPE production of bFGF and TGF-βs. © 1994 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.","['basic fibroblast growth factor', '  fibrin', '  growth factor', '  peroxidase', '  plasminogen activator inhibitor 1', '  streptavidin', '  tissue plasminogen activator', '  transforming growth factor beta1', '  von willebrand factor', '  adult', '  aged', '  antigen detection', '  article', '  blood vessel wall', '  case report', '  cell migration', '  child', '  choroid', '  choroid capillary layer', '  choroid vascularization', '  controlled study', '  eye injury', '  female', '  fibrinolysis', '  human', '  human tissue', '  immunohistochemistry', '  immunoreactivity', '  male', '  pigment epithelium', '  preschool child', '  priority journal', '  retina', '  retina blood vessel', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell', '  tissue distribution', '  Aged', '  Aged', ' 80 and over', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Blood Coagulation Factors', '  Case Report', '  Female', '  Growth Substances', '  Human', '  Immunoenzyme Techniques', '  Infant', '  Male', '  Middle Age', '  Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1', '  Retinal Diseases', ' "" Support', ' Non-U.S. Govt""', ' "" Support', ' U.S. Govt', ' P.H.S.""']",24.0,Informa Healthcare,English,Article,['United States'],"[EY01765, National Heart, Blood Institute, National Eye Institute, P30EY001765, RPB]",['United States'],1994 - 2003,1

Systemic changes related to blood pressure and carotid artery disease are commonly manifested on the ophthalmic examination. Ocular ischemic changes have been observed in patients with unusual aortic or congenital cardiac disorders. The ophthalmologist plays an important role in the detection of patients who are at risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. The hematologic disorders affecting the eye are subdivided into benign and malignant categories. A spectrum of diseases that include sickle cell hemoglobinopathy, aplastic anemia, leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma are discussed. With increased patient survival time after bone marrow transplantation, secondary ophthalmic complications are being identified.

555,High-resolution histologic analysis of the human choroidal vasculature,1994,Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science,"Purpose. To develop a high-resolution histologic technique to study the postmortem human choroidal vasculature in dual perspective: vascular pattern in the flat perspective and structure in cross sections. Methods. Fresh whole human choroids were denuded of retinal pigment epithelium, fixed, incubated for enzyme histochemical demonstration of alkaline phosphatase (APase) activity, bleached with hydrogen peroxide, and flat-embedded in glycol methacrylate. Vascular patterns were examined and documented en bloc, and subsequent serial sectioning was performed through specific sites of interest. Results. APase staining provided excellent visualization of the entire choroidal vasculature en bloc. Reaction product was generally more prominent in the choriocapillaris and collecting venules than in veins or arterioles, whereas arteries had the least activity. Diminished activity within focal regions of the choriocapillaris was observed in the far periphery of most aged subjects and was related to loss of endothelium and capillary atrophy. Hard drusen were generally observed in clusters located near collecting venules and appeared unrelated to any underlying angiopathy, whereas basal linear and laminar deposits were most often associated with regions of capillary dropout. Choroids from patients with diabetes demonstrated angiopathic changes consisting of extensive capillary dropout, beaded capillaries, neovascularization, and Bruch's membrane degeneration. Conclusions. The benefits afforded by this method of analysis are that choroidal vasculature can be visualized in the native state and that nonvascular structures are retained for simultaneous analysis with vascular pattern and blood vessel structure.","['article', '  bruch membrane', '  choroid vascularization', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  histopathology', '  human', '  human tissue', '  immunohistochemistry', '  neovascularization (pathology)', '  priority journal', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Aged', '  Aged', ' 80 and over', '  Alkaline Phosphatase', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Capillaries', '  Child', '  Child', ' Preschool', '  Choroid', '  Diabetes Mellitus', '  Endothelium', ' Vascular', '  Histocytochemistry', '  Human', '  Infant', '  Middle Age', ' "" Support', ' Non-U.S. Govt""', ' "" Support', ' U.S. Govt', ' P.H.S.""']",216.0,,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Heart, Blood Institute, National Eye Institute, P30EY001765]",['United States'],1994 - 2003,1
556,New classification of peripheral retinal vascular changes in sickle cell disease,1994,British Journal of Ophthalmology,"The systemic complications of homozygous sickle cell disease (SS) are more severe than in sickle cell haemoglobin C (SC) disease, and yet visual loss due to proliferative retinopathy is more common in the latter. This anomaly is unexplained. It is believed that proliferative disease occurs in response to closure of the peripheral retinal vasculature, yet a systematic longitudinal survey of the peripheral retinal vascular bed has not been undertaken. In the Jamaica Sickle Cohort study all subjects are scheduled to receive annual ocular examination and fluorescein angiography. The results have now been analysed in subjects with SS and SC disease using a new classification system based on a comparison of the peripheral retinal vascular bed with that recorded in the cohort with normal haemoglobin (AA) genotype. The vascular patterns could be classified as qualitatively normal (type I) or abnormal (type II). An abnormal vascular pattern was identified more commonly with age, in a significantly larger proportion of subjects with SC than SS disease, and was associated with the development of proliferative disease. In order to establish the dynamics of change, the angiograms were analysed in the 18 subjects (24 eyes) who developed proliferative disease. It is shown that a qualitatively normal vascular pattern may be retained despite loss of capillary bed and posterior displacement of the vascular border. A border which is qualitatively abnormal does not revert to normal, and once abnormal, continuous evolution may occur before development of proliferative lesions. The peripheral border of the retinal vasculature was too peripheral to photographed in 13 of the 24 eyes before it becoming qualitatively abnormal. It is concluded that a normal border, if posterior, results from gradual modification of the capillary bed and indicates low risk of proliferative disease. A qualitatively abnormal vascular border occurs as a radical alteration of retinal perfusion in subjects in whom little modification of the vascular bed occurred before the event, and signals risk ofproliferative disease. This classification system is useful in identifying the likelihood of threat to vision in young Jamaicans with sickle cell disease, and the higher frequency of proliferative retinopathy in SC can be explained by the higher prevalence of a qualitatively abnormal peripheral retinal vasculature.","['hemoglobin', '  hemoglobin s', '  adolescent', '  article', '  child', '  controlled study', '  disease classification', '  fluorescence angiography', '  human', '  major clinical study', '  priority journal', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  retina blood vessel', '  retina blood vessel occlusion', '  retina capillary', '  school child', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Adolescent', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Capillaries', '  Child', '  Child', ' Preschool', '  Cohort Studies', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Hemoglobin SC Disease', '  Human', '  Retina', '  Retinal Vessels', '  Retrospective Studies', '  Risk Factors']",44.0,BMJ Publishing Group,English,Article,"['United Kingdom', ' Jamaica', ' United States']",[],['United Kingdom'],1994 - 2003,3

We confirmed its presence biomicroscopically in cases with posterior vitreous detachment and found it mostly associated with retinal vascular diseases, usually manifesting as two dense vitreous membranes with defects. When posterior vitreoschisis develops in an otherwise normal eye, it may not manifest as two membranes, but can form a crescent-shaped, optically empty space in the posterior vitreous cavity. Because its management is different, posterior vitreoschisis should be differentiated from other, apparently similar, conditions, especially posterior vitreous detachment.","['adult', '  aged', '  article', '  biomicroscopy', '  case report', '  clinical feature', '  differential diagnosis', '  echography', '  female', '  human', '  priority journal', '  retina blood vessel occlusion', '  slit lamp', '  vitreous disease', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Case Report', '  Cell Membrane', '  Diabetic Retinopathy', '  Eye Diseases', '  Female', '  Human', '  Microscopy', '  Middle Age', '  Photography', '  Retinal Detachment', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Vitreous Body']",31.0,,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],1984 - 1993,1

563,Dual-Perspective Analysis of Vascular Formations in Sickle Cell Retinopathy,1993,Archives of Ophthalmology,"To examine the sickle cell retina in dual perspective (vascular patterns en bloc and structure in serial sections) to gain new insights into sickle cell retinopathy. We analyzed the retinas of two patients with sickle cell disease (a 54-year-old patient with hemoglobin SC, heterozygous for the S and C mutation in the beta chain of the globin gene, and a 20-month-old patient with sickle cell anemia [SS], homozygous for the S mutation) using the previously described adenosine diphosphatase flat-embedding technique. The dual-perspective analysis afforded by our technique revealed that the primary site of occlusions was located at the precapillary level. An unusual neovascular formation, the hairpin loop, was observed in both patients' retinas and appeared to result from recanalization of the wall of an occluded vessel. Many autoinfarcted preretinal neovascular formations were observed in the older SC patient. Two patent preretinal formations were studied in detail and their evolution appeared to be influenced by mechanical factors. The vessels appeared to have been extruded from the retina, perhaps owing to hydrostatic pressure secondary to downstream occlusions. Small pigmented lesions consisting of retinal pigment epithelial cells ensheathing channels that resembled autoinfarcted vessels were found in the eye of the SC patient. This study illustrates unusual morphological features of intraretinal and preretinal neovascularization and of chorioretinal lesions in sickle cell retinopathy and suggests alternative mechanisms for their formation. © 1993, American Medical Association.

564,Spontaneous and Traumatic Vitreous Hemorrhage,1993,Ophthalmology,"Purpose: The authors sought to provide relevant data regarding the demographic and clinical aspects of spontaneous and traumatic vitreous hemorrhages to guide clinicians in better delineating the expected etiologic patterns of these hemorrhages in an urban environment. Methods: The records of 253 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed vitreous hemorrhage seen in a general eye clinic were selected for retrospective analysis. To minimize selection bias of a tertiary care center, patients who were referred to the clinic by outside ophthalmologists for vitreoretinal consultation or those with a history of recent intraocular surgery, postoperative complications, or loss to follow-up were excluded from study. Demographic, ocular, and general medical variables were tabulated for the 200 patients (230 eyes) who met our inclusion criteria. Results: Fifty percent of the patients were black, 26% were white, 23% were Hispanic, and 1% was Oriental. The causes of vitreous hemorrhage were proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) (35.2%), trauma (18.3%), retinal vein occlusion (7.4%); retinal tear without a detachment (7.0%), posterior vitreous detachment (6.5%), proliferative sickle retinopathy (5.7%), retinal tear with a detachment (4.8%), subretinal neovascularization from macular degeneration (2.2%), hypertensive retinopathy (1.7%), unknown (2.5%), and other causes (8.7%). Among black patients with spontaneous vitreous hemorrhage, sickle cell retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion were major causes, each accounting for more than 15% of the cases. Systemic hypertension was associated with vitreous hemorrhage from retinal vein occlusion. Conclusion: The authors propose that despite the wide array of causative factors of vitreous hemorrhage, the evaluation of demographic, ocular, and medical variables can significantly aid clinicians in identifying its etiologic patterns. © 1993, American Academy of Ophthalmology, Inc.

Forty‐nine patients had 64 episodes of septicemia among a population of 786 SS patients observed for 8,138 person‐years. Peak frequency of infection occurred between 1968‐1971 and 1975‐1981 with a conspicuous absence of episodes in 1972, 1973, 1982‐1984, and 1986‐1987, thus demonstrating cycles of high and low attack rates. The annual age‐specific incidence rate of septicemia varied from 64.5 (1965) to 421.1 (1980) per 1,000 person‐years for those under 2 years of age and never exceeded 10.2 per 1,000 in those over 4 years of age. Following the introduction of pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine in 1978, incidence of infection decreased in SS children greater than 2 years of age. No modification of the risk of infection was observed in immunized children less than 2 years of age. During these three decades, there has been a ten‐fold increase in the number of SS adults over 20 years of age. The relative risk of chronic sickle complications comparing the survivors of septicemia to the non‐infected patients was: subsequent death 1.76, retinopathy 4.06, avascular necrosis 1.95, symptomatic cholelithiasis 1.33, stroke 1.30, and priapsim 1.26. These data suggest that prognosis for lifetime severe SS is initially manifested as an increased risk of septicemia during childhood.

571,Relationship between peripheral vascular closure and proliferative retinopathy in sickle cell disease,1991,Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology,"In a study involving 97 patients with hemoglobin SC sickle cell disease (Hb SC) and 87 subjects with hemoglobin SS sickle cell disease (Hb SS) on the island of Curaçao, we found a higher incidence of peripheral retinal vascular closure and proliferative retinopathy in the former as compared with the latter. Examination of composite fluorescein angiograms obtained from 15 Hb SS and 36 Hb SC patients, whose mean and median age were the same and in whom more advanced stages of sickle retinopathy were equally represented, revealed statistically significantly smaller measurements of perfused retina (indicative of larger areas of non-perfusion) in Hb SC patients as compared with Hb SS patients (P=0.002, P=0.014) as well as in subjects exhibiting neovascularization as compared with those who did not (P=0.022, P=0.004). This suggests that a vaso-occlusive tendency in the retina is greater in individuals with Hb SC than in those with Hb SS; the more extensive ischemic areas provide a stimulus for neovascularization, explaining the higher prevalence of proliferative retinopathy in the former patients as compared with the latter. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.","['hemoglobin c', '  hemoglobin s', '  adult', '  article', '  blood vessel occlusion', '  disease classification', '  disease course', '  disease severity', '  fluorescence angiography', '  human', '  incidence', '  major clinical study', '  netherlands antilles', '  preschool child', '  priority journal', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  retina neovascularization', '  school child', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Comparative Study', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Fundus Oculi', '  Human', '  Incidence', '  Netherlands Antilles', '  Prevalence', '  Retinal Artery Occlusion', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retinal Neovascularization']",13.0,Springer-Verlag,English,Article,['Netherlands'],[],['Netherlands'],1984 - 1993,1
572,Sickle cell anemia: βS-Gene-cluster haplotypes as prognostic indicators of vital organ failure,1991,Seminars in Hematology,"Identification of the βs-gene-cluster haplo-type and α-gene status provide a useful tool to improve the possibility for early detection in high-risk SS patients. The DNA polymorphisms of the βs-gene-cluster modify the clinical course in sickle cell anemia especially as it involves the risk of end-stage organ failure of the kidney, lung, and brain. In both Africa and America, the CAR βs haplotype increases the risk of developing irreversible complications at an early age. The degree of anemia, the Hb F concentration, and the preservation (or lack thereof) of Gγ Hb F is haplotype dependent 52 and correlates with the overall clinical course of the patient.52,57 Further modulation of the clinical course by the coinheritance of α-thalassemia-2 tends to decrease the risk of soft tissue organ failure but increases the risk of osteonecrosis. A single individual can be expected to fit into the overall pattern. Some sickle related illness will eventually occur in all patients. In the presence of a Senegal haplotype, the patient's health is better, with the CAR haplotype it is always worse; severity is intermediate in the Benin. These genetic markers can be used to identify the endangered patient before the onset of irreversible major organ failure. The high risk SS patient with a CAR chromosome or one who is homozygous Ben without α-thalassemia-2 should be monitored closely for evidence of vasculopathy-induced microinfarction of the brain, kidneys, or lungs. Such a patient needs preventive therapy before suffering a major hemisphere stroke, losing kidney function, or developing cor pulmonale secondary to restrictive lung disease. By using a combination of genetic, clinical, and laboratory21 predictive variables together with noninvasive diagnostic techniques such as cerebral MRI or CT imaging and pulmonary function tests, it is possible to identify patients with ischemic damage before advanced progression. Bone marrow transplantation, long-term chemotherapy or other interventive measures should be considered relatively early before the brain, kidney, and lung vasculopathy progresses to irreversible organ damage. © 1991.","['adolescent', '  adult', '  article', '  brain', '  child', '  clinical article', '  female', '  gene expression', '  human', '  kidney disease', '  leg ulcer', '  lung disease', '  male', '  necrosis', '  priority journal', '  prognosis', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  side effect', '  Adult', '  Age Factors', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Child', '  Globins', '  Haplotypes', '  Human', '  Multigene Family', '  Multiple Organ Failure']",109.0,,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],1984 - 1993,1

Studying 81 Hb SS and 97 Hb SC patients, we were able to confirm the correlation between iris atrophy and proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR), the correlation between Hb SC and proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR) and the major role of PSR in blindness in sickle cell patients. In Hb SC patients over the age of 18 PSR occurred in 50%, leading to vitreous hemorrhage in 18% and to retinal detachment in 8%. We found a frequency of blindness in one eye (fingers counting or less) of 4% in the entire sickle population, and 6% among Hb SC patients.

In both genotypes progression of PSR was most frequent between ages 20 and 39 years. Spontaneous regression was more common in SS disease (p=0.01), and more likely to proceed to complete non-perfusion. In SC disease PSR tended to be stable in patients aged 40 and over, and non-perfused PSR lesions were significantly more likely to reperfuse (p=0.01) than in SS disease. In both genotypes regression was not influenced by size or elevation of the PSR lesion.

579,An update on techniques of photocoagulation treatment of proliferative sickle cell retinopathy,1991,Eye (Basingstoke),"Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (PSR) can lead to visual loss from vitreous haemorrhage and traction or rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. We review two techniques of photocoagulation for PSR, feeder vessel photocoagulation and scatter photocoagulation. A prospective randomised trial of feeder vessel photocoagulation for PSR demonstrated that the incidence of vitreous haemorrhage and visual loss was diminished in eyes which were treated. Since this technique of treatment is difficult and can be associated with choroidal neovascularisation and retinal tears, scatter photocoagulation has also been tested. A prospective randomised trial of scatter photocoagulation for PSR demonstrated a decreased incidence of vitreous haemorrhage and visual loss in treated eyes compared to untreated eyes. No complications of scatter treatment were noted. We presently recommend local scatter photocoagulation to areas ofPSR. In unreliable patients, we recommend 360 degrees of peripheral circumferential treatment as otherwise new seafans will develop. If scatter photocoagulation does not result in sufficient regression of the neovascularisation and vision threatening complications such as vitreous haemorrhage continue, feeder vessel treatment can be used to supplement the scatter treatment. © 1991, College of Ophthalmologists.

585,Relationship of clinical severity to packed cell rheology in sickle cell anemia,1991,Blood,"There is wide variation in the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease (SCD) from one affected individual to another. Many investigators have sought to discern parameters that would explain this variability. In the present studies we have attempted to correlate the frequency of painful events and the extent of end organ failure in SCD with rheologic properties of packed suspensions of sickle cells, using a magneto-acoustic ball microrheometer developed in our laboratory. Using this device we have measured the steady-state viscosity, and the viscous and elastic moduli of cell suspensions in 16 individuals with hemoglobin SS disease who were untransfused and in their steady state. The rheologic parameters were then correlated with clinical parameters. The clinical parameters measured were emergency department visits, hospitalizations, hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, age, and end organ failure (nephropathy, avascular necrosis of bone, stroke, retinopathy, resting hypoxemia after acute chest syndrome(s), leg ulcer, and priapism with impotence). The P value for the correlation between the steady state viscosity and end organ failure was .001 with a correlation coefficient (R value) of .73. The P value for the correlation between the viscous modulus of viscosity and end organ failure was .00006 with an R value of .83. The P value for the correlation between the elastic modulus of viscosity and end organ failure was .0006 with an R value of .76.

586,"Large-vessel occlusion in sickle cell disease: Pathogenesis, clinical consequences, and therapeutic implications",1991,Medical Hypotheses,"Much of the morbidity and mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by tissue ischemia and infarction resulting from vascular occlusion. Research in this area has been dominated by the hypothesis that vascular occlusion in SCD is due primarily to microvascular obstruction by sickle erythrocytes (SS RBC), yet there is no direct evidence that microvascular occlusion is responsible for any of the vasocclusive complications of SCD. In this paper an alternate hypothesis is proposed: that thrombotic occlusion of larger arteries and veins is an important factor in many of the vasocclusive complications of SCD. Large-vessel cerebral arterial disease (intimal hyperplasia with superimposed thrombosis) has clearly been established as the most important cause of stroke in SCD, and considerable evidence suggests that pulmonary arterial thrombosis/embolism is a major cause of pulmonary infarction and hypertension. The involvement of large-vessel thrombosis in painful crisis, aseptic necrosis of bone, priapism, leg ulcers, retinopathy, and miscarriage has not been adequately investigated. Large-vessel occlusion in SCD is probably a consequence of the abnormal adhesive and procoagulant properties of SS RBC, which produce endothelial damage, secondary intimal proliferation, and thrombosis. Techniques currently used to treat large-vessel occlusion in other disorders (antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents, thrombolytic therapy, angioplasty, endarterectomy, and vascular bypass surgery) should be considered in sickle cell subjects with large-vessel occlusion, especially in the cerebral vasculature. © 1991.","['acetylsalicylic acid', '  anticoagulant agent', '  antithrombocytic agent', '  fibrinolytic agent', '  blood vessel occlusion', '  brain vein', '  human', '  priority journal', '  review', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Anticoagulants', '  Cerebrovascular Disorders', '  Female', '  Fibrinolytic Agents', '  Human', '  Lung Diseases', '  Male', '  Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors', '  Pregnancy', '  Vascular Diseases']",57.0,,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],1984 - 1993,1

Major organ failure is first clinically apparent as autosplenectomy, then during childhood presents as cerebral infarction and atrophy, and finally culminates in young adulthood as end stage renal failure (glomerulosclerosis), sickle chronic lung disease, intracranial hemorrhage, retinopathy, disabling leg ulcers, and generalized osteonecrosis. The vascular damage begins years before the overt clinical symptoms are apparent with no pain to act as a signal. Organ damage is progressive and irreversible. The rate of progression is genetically controlled from birth. Except for the management of life-threatening infections that are associated with the non-functioning spleen, disease expression has not been altered by therapy. The focus of future clinical investigations must be the prevention of the vasculopathy and tissue damage which is induced by the sickle red cell. © 1990 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.","['adolescent', '  adult', '  bone necrosis', '  brain hemorrhage', '  brain infarction', '  chronic kidney failure', '  chronic lung disease', '  female', '  human', '  leg ulcer', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  mortality', '  priapism', '  priority journal', '  retinopathy', '  review', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Cerebral Hemorrhage', '  Cerebral Infarction', '  Human', '  Kidney Failure', ' Chronic', '  Lung Diseases', '  Multiple Organ Failure', '  Osteonecrosis', '  Spleen']",60.0,Informa Healthcare,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],1984 - 1993,1

All patients underwent pars plana vitrectomy and internal subretinal hemorrhage drainage. The causes of subretinal hemorrhages in group 1 were primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (three eyes), complications from scleral buckling procedures (three eyes), traumatic retinal detachments (two eyes), and sickle cell retinopathy associated with anticoagulation therapy after a pulmonary embolus (one eye). Group 2 consisted of five eyes with massive subretinal hemorrhage associated with age-related macular degeneration. In group I, recurrent postoperative retinal detachment occurred in five eyes but reattachment was achieved in eight of the nine eyes, and final visual acuities were 20/400 or better in those eight eyes. In group 2, marked subretinal fibrosis occurred in two eyes. Although three eyes had improved visual acuities, final visual acuities were 5/200 or worse in all five eyes. © 1990, American Medical Association.

593,Hypoxic viscosity and diabetic retinopathy,1990,British Journal of Ophthalmology,"Diabetic and sickle retinopathy have features in common - for example, venous dilatation, microaneurysms, and capillary closure preceding neovascularisation. Bearing in mind that haemoglobin in poorly controlled diabetes is abnormal and that extremely low oxygen tensions (known to cause sickling) exist in the healthy cat retina, we wished to explore the possibility that diabetic blood, like that of sickle cell disease, may become more viscous when deoxygenated. To do this we measured whole blood viscosity, under oxygenated and deoxygenated conditions, of 23 normal persons, 23 diabetic patients without retinopathy, and 34 diabetic patients with retinopathy. The shear rate used was 230 s-1, which is similar to that thought to prevail in the major retinal veins. The viscosity of blood from normal persons, corrected for packed cell volume, did not change significantly on deoxygenation: mean 4*54 (SD 0.38) cps, versus, 4*57 (0-39) paired t test, p=0-66. Similarly the blood from diabetics without retinopathy showed no change: 4.42 (0.45) versus 4*42 (0O30), p=0.98; whereas the blood from patients with retinopathy changed from 4.82 (0.48) to 4.95 (0.63), p=0027. The hypoxic viscosity ratio (deoxygenated divided by oxygenated viscosity) correlated with total serum cholesterol (r=0.44, p=0O018) but not with HbAl, serum glucose, triglycerides, or age. A disproportionate increase in venous viscosity relative to arterial viscosity would lead to increased intraluminal and transmural pressure and therefore exacerbate leakage across capillary walls.","['article', '  blood viscosity', '  diabetes mellitus', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  human', '  human cell', '  hypoxia', '  major clinical study', '  priority journal', '  shear rate', '  Adult', '  Blood Viscosity', '  Comparative Study', '  Diabetes Mellitus', '  Diabetic Retinopathy', '  Human', '  Middle Age', '  Oxygen', '  Partial Pressure', ' "" Support', ' Non-U.S. Govt""']",12.0,BMJ Publishing Group,English,Article,['United Kingdom'],[],['United States'],1984 - 1993,1

In 27 eyes the neovascularisation was chorioretinal alone and in 35 eyes choriovitreal. Chorioretinal neovascularisation (CRN) was a benign complication but may convert to choriovitreal neovascularisation (CVN). Late sequelae of CVN included vitreous haemorrhage, posterior vitreous face fibrosis, and tractional retinal detachment. Visual loss (of ≥ 3 Snellen lines for ≥ 3 months) occurred in nine eyes affected by choroidal neovascularisation, though because of other pathology this could not always be attributed to the choroidal neovascularisation. The incidence of visual loss in CVN affected eyes was significantly greater, by survival curve analysis, than in eyes affected by CRN alone. Permanent visual loss from tractional retinal detachment definitely attributable to CVN occurred in 2/35 (6%) eyes.","['article', '  human', '  laser coagulation', '  major clinical study', '  priority journal', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Aged', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Choroid', '  Female', '  Human', '  Iatrogenic Disease', '  Light Coagulation', '  Male', '  Middle Age', '  Neovascularization', ' Pathologic', '  Retinal Detachment', '  Vision Disorders', '  Vitreous Hemorrhage']",12.0,BMJ Publishing Group,English,Article,['Jamaica'],[],['Jamaica'],1984 - 1993,1

PSR was more common in SC disease, in which there was a significant predominance of males, and it increased with age in both genotypes. In SC disease the risk of developing PSR was highest between 15 and 24 years in males, between 20 and 39 years in females, and in SS disease between 25 and 39 years in both sexes. PSR tended to be bilateral, especially in SC disease. There was no evidence of familial clustering of PSR in SC siblings, and insufficient numbers of SS siblings were available to test for clustering. Haematological risk factors associated with PSR in SS disease were a high haemoglobin in males and a low fetal haemoglobin in both sexes and in SC disease, a high mean cell volume, and a low fetal haemoglobin in females.","['hemoglobin c', '  article', '  female', '  human', '  major clinical study', '  male', '  priority journal', '  proliferative retinopathy', '  risk factor', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell trait', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Age Factors', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Child', '  Child', ' Preschool', '  Female', '  Hemoglobin SC Disease', '  Human', '  Incidence', '  Infant', '  Infant', ' Newborn', '  Jamaica', '  Male', '  Prevalence', '  Regression Analysis', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Risk Factors', '  Sex Factors']",67.0,BMJ Publishing Group,English,Article,"['Jamaica', ' Trinidad and Tobago']",[],"['Jamaica', 'Trinidad and Tobago']",1984 - 1993,2

Mild an infrequent signs in anterior and posterior segments were found, but no cases of sickle cell retinopathy of any kind were deteceted. These results were compared with the reported findings in black American children of African origin with the same disease.

597,Ticlopidine: An Updated Review of its Pharmacology and Therapeutic Use in Platelet-Dependent Disorders,1990,Drugs,"Synopsis Ticlopidine inhibits platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and most other platelet agonists in ex vivo studies of human platelets. The drug also improves other abnormalities of platelet function seen in patients with cerebrovascular disease, peri-pheral arterial disease, ischaemic heart disease or other conditions involving platelet hyperaggregation. Abnormal platelet activity has been implicated in a variety of clinical conditions in which patients are at high risk of thromboembolic events, and thus the effectiveness of ticlopidine has been investigated in such patients. Since the initial review of the drug appeared in the Journal, data from several large multicentre studies have shown that ticlopidine has a substantial benefit to offer patients who have experienced transient ischaemic attacks or stroke, and in those with peripheral arterial disease or ischaemic heart disease. Ticlopidine reduces the incidence of further stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death, and is superior to placebo and aspirin in this regard in studies of patients with recent stroke or transient ischaemic attacks, or intermittent claudication. Ticlopidine is equally effective in both men and women and also improves symptoms of claudication in patients with peripheral arterial disease, and appears to reduce anginal pain. Patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage and sickle cell disease have shown some improvement with ticlopidine administration. The drug reduces thromboembolic events and re-stenosis in patients undergoing haemodialysis and cardiac surgery, and appears to prevent the progression of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. Ticlopidine in large clinical trials is associated with a higher incidence of adverse effects than placebo and an overall incidence similar to aspirin. Most adverse effects do not require withdrawal of treatment. Gastrointestinal symptoms (particularly diarrhoea) are most common, occurring almost twice as frequently with ticlopidine as with aspirin. Other adverse effects associated with ticlopidine include skin rash, haemorrhagic disorders, and haematological effects; these latter effects require careful monitoring of patients during the initial weeks of therapy. In conclusion, ticlopidine is a valuable addition to the prophylactic treatments available for the management of patients with cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease or ischaemic heart disease, who present a high risk of thromboembolic events. Although tolerability may be a problem for some patients, the overall benefit conferred by the drug would appear to outweigh this potential disadvantage. Because of its antiplatelet activity, ticlopidine has a promising role in other disorders mediated by platelet dysfunction. However, the precise role of the drug in these additional therapeutic indications awaits clarification with wider clinical experience. Pharmacological Properties Ticlopidine is a thienopyridine derivative which has a broad spectrum antiaggregating activity. In ex vivo studies of platelets obtained from healthy volunteers and patients with cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, ischaemic heart disease, or other conditions associated with platelet hyperaggregation, ticlopidine inhibits ADP-induced platelet aggregation. A maximal effect was seen 3 to 5 days after repeated administration in healthy volunteers and this can be seen for up to 10 days after withdrawal of drug treatment. Inhibition of ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by other platelet agonists such as arachidonic acid, collagen, thrombin and platelet activating factor (PAF)-acether has also been reported, although this may not be a direct effect but rather a result of the inhibitory effect of ticlopidine on aggregation produced by ADP released by low concentrations of these agonists. Other ticlopidine-induced effects resulting from its interaction with ADP and platelets include a decrease in platelet deposition on atheromatous plaque in patients with cerebrovascular disease, reduced fibrinogen levels and blood viscosity in patients with peripheral arterial disease, and normalised platelet adhesiveness, erythrocyte deformability and β-thromboglobulin release in diabetic patients. Ticlopidine also prolongs bleeding time, with a maximal effect seen after 5 to 6 days in volunteers. The influence of ticlopidine on a variety of platelet agonists suggests a common site of action at an early stage of the platelet activating process. No comprehensive mechanism of action has been proposed, but inhibition of the ADP-induced exposure of the fibrinogen-binding site of the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex has been demonstrated. About 80 to 90% of an oral ticlopidine dose is absorbed, with plasma concentrations peaking at 1 to 3 hours. Steady-state peak and trough plasma concentrations of 0.9 mg/ L and 0.2 mg/L, respectively, have been achieved after ticlopidine 250mg twice daily for 14 days. Ticlopidine is rapidly and extensively metabolised, with 1 metabolite more active than the parent drug. A terminal elimination half-life of 96h at steady-state has been reported in healthy volunteers. In the elderly the AUC and half-life of ticlopidine are significantly prolonged compared with younger volunteers after a single dose but this was not significant at steady-state. No studies evaluating the pharmacokinetics of ticlopidine in patients with major organ dysfunction have been published. Therapeutic Trials Since the initial review of ticlopidine appeared in the Journal, attention has focused on the effectiveness of the drug in patients at high risk of thromboembolic events, i.e. those with transient ischaemic attacks and stroke, peripheral arterial disease or ischaemic heart disease. A large multicentre trial, the Canadian-American Ticlopidine Study (CATS) completed since the first review, has demonstrated that ticlopidine administered as a 250mg dose twice daily in patients who had had a recent stroke reduced the incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death by 30.2% compared with placebo. Another large trial in more than 3000 patients [the Ticlopidine Aspirin Stroke Study (TASS)] has shown that ticlopidine has a more pronounced preventative effect on death from all causes or nonfatal stroke compared with aspirin. This was statistically significant within 1 year and was maintained over a 5-year period. Ticlopidine appears to be equally effective in women and men. Major clinical trials in patients with intermittent claudication resulting from peripheral arterial disease demonstrate that ticlopidine 250mg twice daily improves walking ability during treatment periods of 6 to 21 months. A reduction in the total mortality rate (by 29.1% compared with placebo), mainly because of its marked effect on ischaemic heart disease mortality, was seen in the Swedish Ticlopidine Multicentre Study (STIMS). In the same trial, the incidence of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischaemic attack was significantly lowered by ticlopidine during an average period of 5.6 years. Results of another multicentre study show that ticlopidine 500 mg/day begun within 48 hours of admission reduces the risk of acute myocardial infarction, myocardial infarction and sudden death, and vascular mortality in patients with unstable angina. Ticlopidine also appears to reduce anginal pain to a similar extent to aspirin if administered within 24 hours of acute myocardial infarction. Other indications in which ticlopidine shows some benefit include the following: prevention of thrombotic events in patients undergoing haemodialysis, coronary artery bypass surgery, carotid endarterectomy or extracorporeal circulation; prevention of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy; and prevention of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid haemorrhage. The effectiveness of the drug in Raynaud’s phenomenon, sickle cell disease, ocular vein occlusion, glomerulonephritis and the prevention of postoperative thrombosis and bleeding remains uncertain. Adverse Effects The findings of a large placebo-controlled study in 1053 patients with a recent thromboembolic stroke show a higher incidence of adverse effects associated with ticlopidine compared with placebo: 54% of ticlopidine recipients and 34% of placebo recipients experienced an adverse symptom over a 3-year period. Of these patients, 12 and 3%, respectively, required withdrawal of treatment. The incidence of adverse effects was roughly similar in patients treated with ticlopidine or aspirin over a 2-to 6-year period, although ticlopidine recipients had almost twice the incidence of diarrhoea and skin rash whereas more peptic ulcers were reported in the aspirin group. The most common adverse effects associated with ticlopidine are gastrointestinal symptoms: diarrhoea is the most frequently reported, affecting about 20% of treated patients. Other effects are skin reactions (urticaria, pruritus, erythema), haemorrhagic disorders (epistaxis, ecchymoses, menorrhagia), and haematological disorders (leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia). These effects are generally not severe and resolve on discontinuation of ticlopidine treatment. The most potentially serious symptoms are haematological disturbances and close monitoring is therefore essential for at least the first 12 weeks of ticlopidine therapy. Abnormal liver function is rare with ticlopidine therapy but in instances where a definite causal relationship was determined, abnormal effects disappeared on withdrawal of treatment. Ticlopidine has also been associated with an increase in total cholesterol levels. Dosage and Administration A daily dosage of ticlopidine 500mg, administered orally as two 250mg tablets with food, is recommended. Up to 4 tablets (daily dosage 1000mg) can be administered for short term treatment but patients require careful monitoring. All patients receiving ticlopidine should be monitored during at least the first 12 weeks because of the risk of haematological disturbances. Ticlopidine is contraindicated in patients receiving high dose heparin, those with a history of bleeding disorders, gastroduodenal ulcer or those in the acute phase of haemorrhagic cerebral vascular accident. © 1990, Adis International Limited.

The proportion of peripheral retinal nonperfusion was derived from fluorescein angiographic frames covering 180° of the temporal periphery. The extent of peripheral retinal capillary nonperfusion was greater in patients with peripheral retinal neovascularization compared with those without neovascularization. Reductions in electroretinogram a- and b-wave amplitudes were found in patients with and without neovascularization. However, such reductions were of greater frequency and magnitude in patients with neovascularization. Electroretinogram abnormalities were restricted to reductions in amplitude; implicit times were generally normal. In terms of the variables of the b-wave luminance-response function, abnormalities were restricted to reductions in the amplitude variable Rmax; values of logK and n were generally within the normal range. Across all patients, there was a significant negative correlation between electroretinogram amplitude measures and capillary nonperfusion, indicating that the electroretinogram provides information about the functional consequences of peripheral capillary nonperfusion in sickle cell retinopathy. © 1990, American Medical Association.

Among them hip involvement was noted in 55 (104 hips). Forty three times the hip involvement occurred in childhood and twelve times in adult life. When the necrosis appeared in childhood (84 hips) the average age was twelve. The deformity involved the femoral head (coxa plana, coxa magna) as well as the neck (short neck, coxa vara). After an average follow-up of nineteen years, clinical and radiological examinations evidenced 64 functional impairments and 25 arthrosis, 10 of which have already been operated on. The necrosis appearing during adult life (20 hips) had the same outcome as idiopathic necroses, leading rapidly to arthrosis after collapse of the sequestrum. It seems that the etiology of the necroses is linked to rheologic disorders, the deformity of the red cells causing arteriolar thromboses. In this series the hip disease was correlated with sickle cell retinopathy as defined after angiography.

Retinal fluorescein angiography images were used and data were taken using the receiver operating characteristic experimental paradigm. Three ophthalmologists with experience ranging from two to 12 years participated in the study. Sixty-eight images were selected from proof sheets of 800 original images. Next, these images were digitized, then each set was shown on its respective display (slide projection for the proof sheet images and CRT for the digital images). These 68 images were from a variety of patients and represented a broad range of normal and abnormal retinas (including diabetic retinopathy, hypertension independent of diabetes, and sickle-cell disease). Results show (1) that there is no difference between the systems in terms of diagnostic accuracy; (2) that certainty of diagnosis was not a function of the system; and (3) that although there was an effect due to experience of the ophthalmologist, it did not affect diagnosis accuracy. We conclude that CRT displays at conventional video resolutions can deliver the needed diagnostic information as well as film. We also hypothesize that digital enhancement techniques can increase the available diagnostic information beyond that of film. © 1989, IEEE.

Sickle cell patients had significantly higher Lanthony error scores and significantly more blue-yellow and mixed color vision defects than controls. Among patients with sickle cell anemia (SS), Lanthony and Farnsworth Munsell 100 Hue test scores were significantly correlated, and both tests showed good agreement in identifying the presence or absence of a color defect.

616,Oxygen therapy and intraocular oxygenation,1987,Transactions of the American Ophthalmological Society,"When delivered to the corneal surface of rabbits or monkeys, 100% oxygen can significantly increase the pO2 in the aqueous humor. Under hyperbaric conditions (two atmospheres), an observed rise in the aqueous pO2 in rabbits breathing room air can be increased further by exposing the rabbit cornea to 100% oxygen. The high oxygen levels under hyperbaric conditions are mediated by intravascular and transcorneal delivery of oxygen. The increase in the pO2 levels in the aqueous can prevent sickling of intracameral human erythrocytes containing sickle hemoglobin. Thus, oxygen therapy transcorneally or systemically could potentially be used to treat a sickle cell hyphema. The exposure of rabbit eyes to 100% oxygen at the corneal surface is followed by autoregulation (constriction) of the iris vasculature. We could demonstrate no constriction in the eyes of two normal human volunteers or of four patients with chronic stable rubeosis iridis. Preretinal vitreous pO2 levels can be significanlty raised by exposing monkeys to hyperbaric 100% oxyen. This procedure may be of value in treating acute, reversible ischemic inner renital diseases. Transcorneal or vascular delivery of oxyen to the eye under normobaric or hyperbaric conditions may be effective in treating ischemic diseases of the anterior segment, such as anterior segment necrosis or rubeosis iridis, or ischemic inner retinal diseases.","['animal experiment', '  aqueous humor', '  hyperbaric oxygen', '  iris blood flow', '  iris rubeosis', '  methodology', '  monkey', '  nonhuman', '  oxygen tension', '  rabbit', '  retina ischemia', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  vitreous body', '  Animal', '  Anterior Eye Segment', '  Aqueous Humor', '  Biological Transport', '  Cornea', '  Female', '  Human', '  Hyperbaric Oxygenation', '  Ischemia', '  Macaca fascicularis', '  Oxygen', '  Rabbits', ' "" Support', ' Non-U.S. Govt""', ' "" Support', ' U.S. Govt', ' P.H.S.""']",33.0,,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Heart, Blood Institute]",['United States'],1984 - 1993,1

623,"Ticlopidine: A Review of its Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic Properties, and Therapeutic Efficacy in Platelet-Dependent Disease States",1987,Drugs,"Synopsis Ticlopidine1 is an inhibitor of platelet action that has been used in the treatment of a variety of disease states in which platelets play a prominent role. Studies in animals and man have demonstrated that ticlopidine is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and variably inhibits aggregation due to collagen, adrenaline (epinephrine), arachidonic acid, thrombin, and platelet activating factor. Inhibition of platelet aggregation is both dose- and time-related, with its onset of activity being 24 to 48 hours, its maximal activity occurring after 3 to 5 days, and its activity still being present 72 hours after a final dose. Ticlopidine also inhibits the release reaction of platelets, prolongs bleeding time, reduces plasma levels of platelet factor 4 and β-throm-boglobulin in patients in whom these proteins are elevated, and may also inhibit platelet adhesion, increase red cell ftltrability and decrease whole blood viscosity. In a large number of animal models, ticlopidine markedly inhibits thrombus formation or graft occlusion. Ticlopidine is well absorbed after oral administration. It is extensively metabolised and at least one of its metabolites is pharmacologically active. Therapeutic trials in patients with chronic arterial occlusion due to thrombangitis obliterans or arteriosclerosis obliterans, post-myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular thromboembolic disease, subarachnoid haemorrhage, vascular shunts or fistulas for haemodialysis, and sickle cell disease have shown promise for the use of ticlopidine. However, trials of patients with intermittent claudication, angina pectoris, diabetes mellitus with micro-vascular disease, aortocoronary bypass grafts, and vascular prostheses have had conflicting results or have shown an unfavourable side effect profile. Further studies are clearly required to establish the role of ticlopidine in many of these areas, some of which are already in progress. Overall, side effects occur in 10 to 15% of patients receiving ticlopidine. The most common side effects are gastrointestinal disturbances and skin rashes. Neither of these necessarily require discontinuation of therapy in most patients. Agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and cholestatic jaundice have also been reported. Bleeding is infrequent except possibly in patients receiving ticlopidine prior to some surgical procedures. Pharmacodynamic Properties In vitro, ticlopidine is a weak inhibitor of platelet aggregation, however it does inhibit Properties endothelial cell growth. After in vivo administration, ex vivo studies show that ticlopidine is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation induced by ADP, however, its ability to inhibit aggregation due to thrombin, collagen, arachidonic acid, adrenaline and platelet activating factor is very variable. Unlike other antiplatelet agents, ticlopidine inhibits both the first and second phases of platelet aggregation, and its effects are both dose- and time-related. The onset of its effects is 24 to 48 hours, with maximal antiaggregating effect measurable after 3 to 5 days of dosing, and its effects are still present up to 72 hours after a final dose. Ticlopidine also prolongs the bleeding time by 2- to 5-fold in a dose-and time-related fashion and inhibits the platelet release reaction. Ticlopidine’s effects on prostaglandins are complex and not fully understood; malondialdehyde synthesis in response to collagen, thrombin, or adrenaline is partially inhibited (as with aspirin), serum thromboxane concentrations are reduced, and the effects of prostacyclin enhanced. Ticlopidine may act by modifying platelet membrane affinity for fibrinogen and/or ADP. Its effects on platelet adhesion are again variable. In patients with elevated β-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 ticlopidine therapy reduces the levels of these proteins. Ticlopidine generally prolongs platelet survival in patients with disease states in which it is reduced, especially in patients shortly after an acute myocardial infarction. Ticlopidine binds to red cell membrane in vitro and reduces the tendency to haemolyse in hypotonic solution. In high concentrations, it delays sickling of red cells of patients with sickle cell disease. Red cell deformability and filtrability may also be increased by ticlopidine. Whole blood, but not plasma, viscosity may also be decreased; thus, rheological activity may contribute to ticlopidine’s overall effects. In a large number of coagulation-dependent animal models, thrombosis induced by chemical, mechanical or electrical methods, or by implantation of artificial surfaces was almost invariably markedly inhibited. In addition, in models of coagulation where platelets play little or no role, ticlopidine consistently prevented pathological changes. Pharmacokinetics Approximately 80 to 90% of an oral dose of ticlopidine is absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring after 1 to 3 hours. Peak concentrations after a single 500mg dose are approximately 0.6 to 0.8 mg/L, whereas a single 1000mg dose has produced peaks of about 2.1 mg/L. Peak ticlopidine concentrations after 250mg doses were given twice daily for 21 days were about 0.9 mg/L. Ticlopidine is rapidly and extensively metabolised. Overall recovery of a radiolabelled dose is about 85%, with unchanged ticlopidine representing only about 2%. At least one metabolite is active. Elimination half-lives of 24 to 33 hours have been reported, but single- and multiple-dose studies have demonstrated a rapid 4-fold reduction in plasma concentrations over 4 to 12 hours. Thus, the true half-life of ticlopidine is not known. No studies on the pharmacokinetics of ticlopidine have been performed in patients with decreased renal or hepatic function. Therapeutic Trials Ticlopidine has been studied in patients with various disease states in which platelets play a major role. In patients with atherosclerotic disease and intermittent claudication, conflicting results have been obtained, with some studies demonstrating an improvement in maximum walking distance and pain-free distance, and others demonstrating no benefit. Five large multicentre trials are under way to help define a role for ticlopidine in this disease. In patients with chronic arterial occlusion due to thrombangitis obliterans or arteriosclerosis obliterans, ticlopidine therapy has been associated with a clear improvement in lower extremity ulcer healing rate and vascular improvements. In patients with angina pectoris, ticlopidine has produced mixed results although the weight of evidence would suggest little, if any, role for ticlopidine in these patients. However, in patients started on ticlopidine within 12 hours of an acute myocardial infarction, platelet survival was improved and cardiac enzyme concentrations were reduced compared to placebo. A role for ticlopidine in the post-infarction period is promising, although large controlled studies are needed. In a large multicentre study, patients with a recent transient ischaemic attack were treated with ticlopidine, with the result of fewer cerebrovascular or cardiovascular ‘events’ than observed with aspirin therapy. Similarly, patients with cerebral infarction treated with ticlopidine suffered fewer relapses than those receiving dipyridamole. In patients with subarachnoid haemorrhages, treated surgically within 3 days of the haemorrhage, ticlopidine reduced the incidence of neurological deficit plus mortality at the time of discharge. Those with angiographically documented vasospasm were especially benefited by ticlopidine, despite a lack of effect of the drug on vasospasm per se. Further large studies are in progress to compare ticlopidine and aspirin. In studies examining the effects of ticlopidine in patients with diabetes mellitus, there has been no evidence of reduced progression of retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, or cardiovascular illness. In uraemic patients in whom AV shunts or fistulas were inserted for vascular access, presurgical initiation of ticlopidine has reduced the incidence of vascular occlusion, and thus the need for clot removal or reconstruction of the vascular device. Additionally, ticlopidine may reduce the degree of leucocyte count drop during dialysis, improve dialyser function, and reduce the dose of heparin needed to prevent clotting during dialysis. In patients undergoing open heart surgery, preoperative initiation of ticlopidine reduces the degree of platelet count drop during extracorporeal circulation. However, the effect of the drug on peri- and postoperative bleeding has been varied, with some studies demonstrating an increase in the degree of bleeding and a requirement for reoperation. Very variable results have been achieved in the use of ticlopidine to prevent occlusion of coronary bypass grafts. Several trials have reported no clinical benefit, whereas the largest study showed significant decreases in graft occlusion compared with placebo. In any event, the initiation of ticlopidine before these operations should be approached with great caution. Patients with ‘Dacron’ prosthetic vascular grafts have undergone clinical trials with ticlopidine, but the drug has not demonstrated efficacy in reducing the degree of platelet adhesion to the graft membrane. In patients with primary glomerulonephritis ticlopidine reduced the degree of proteinuria as well as dipyridamole, but has a greater potential to reduce the degree of haematuria, and a greater effect on improving creatinine clearance. In two studies in patients with sickle cell disease, ticlopidine reduced the incidence, duration, and severity of infarctive crises, and reduced the degree of pulmonary arteriovenous shunting. Side Effects Approximately 10 to 15% of patients receiving ticlopidine have experienced side effects, the most common of which have been gastrointestinal complaints and skin rash. Approximately 10% experience gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, or diarrhoea, occasionally requiring discontinuation of therapy. Administration of the drug with food may reduce the problem. Bleeding during ticlopidine therapy is an unusual side effect, but is dangerous in patients who must undergo surgery or another invasive procedure. In patients undergoing AV access insertion, there has been no increase in bleeding, but in patients undergoing open heart surgery, the risk of bleeding may be increased with ticlopidine. Agranulocytosis, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and erythroleukaemia have been reported during therapy with ticlopidine. Elevation of liver function tests are unusual with ticlopidine therapy, but occasionally cholestatic jaundice or hepatitis have been reported. Ticlopidine may increase total serum cholesterol, as well as LDL- and VLDL-cholesterol and other lipoproteins, without affecting HDL-cholesterol. Drug Interactions In three separate trials, the combination of aspirin and ticlopidine seemed to display additive to synergistic activity as platelet inhibitors. Corticosteroids, given orally or as a single intravenous injection, can reduce the prolonged bleeding time caused by ticlopidine, without altering its inhibition of platelet aggregation. Dosage and Administration In the majority of clinical trials, the dose of ticlopidine has been 500 mg/day, given as 2 equally divided doses per day, generally with meals. In some studies, 750 mg/day has been given, and this higher dose may be more efficacious in some settings. Dosing of ticlopidine prior to surgery may possibly increase the risk of operative bleeding. © 1987, ADIS Press Limited.

625,Quantification of macular ischaemia in sickle cell retinopathy,1987,British Journal of Ophthalmology,"Macular ischaemia has a central role in the pathophysiology and prognosis of retinal macular disease. We attempted to quantitate two of its major components as follows: vascular non-perfusion, by measuring the foveal avascular zone (FAZ), using fluorescein angiography; and functional damage, using automated perimetry of the central 30°. Sickle cell disease was chosen for study because it was considered a prototype for a purely ischaemic retinopathy without an exudative component. We found that the FAZ measurement was reproducible and that the patients with maculopathy had statistically larger FAZs than the normal controls (p = 0.016, Wilcoxon rank sum test). In addition, scotomas measured by visual field perimetry were significantly larger in the sickle cell patients with maculopathty than in those without maculopathy. Our results showed that angiography and perimetry of the central 30° were more sensitive tests for the detection of ischaemic macular disease than visual acuity and that macular ischaemia could be quantified by their use.","['blood and hemopoietic system', '  diagnosis', '  etiology', '  fluorescence angiography', '  human', '  major clinical study', '  perimetry', '  priority journal', '  retina ischemia', '  retina macula lutea', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  therapy', '  visual system']",22.0,,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Heart, Blood Institute, National Eye Institute]",[],1984 - 1993,1

Three cases were satisfactorily treated with the Nd-YAG laser application alone, two eventually required conventional vitreoretinal surgery, and one patient's condition stabilized despite failure of the treatment. Complications from the treatment occurred in three cases and included subretinal (choroidal) hemorrhage, preretinal hemorrhage, microperforation of a retinal vein, and focal areas of damage to the retinal pigment epithelium.

628,Electroretinographic Findings in Sickle Cell Retinopathy,1987,Archives of Ophthalmology,"We obtained electroretinograms (ERGs) from normal subjects and from patients with sickle cell disease. The ERG components (a-wave, b-wave, and oscillatory potentials) obtained from normal subjects and patients without peripheral retinal neovascularization did not differ in either amplitude or implicit time. However, ERG components obtained from patients with peripheral retinal neovascularization were reduced in amplitude compared with those obtained from normal subjects or patients without neovascularization. The reduced a-wave, b-wave, and oscillatory potential amplitudes may have been due to photoreceptor dysfunction secondary to choroidal ischemia or possibly increased oxygen demands by the inner retina. Ischemia of the inner retina may also have contributed to the altered b-wave and oscillatory potentials. These results suggest that ERG provides a means of assessing the consequence of peripheral retinal ischemia to retinal cell function and could be of value in monitoring patients with sickle cell disease for the development of clinically significant peripheral retinal neovascularization. © 1987 American Association All rights reserved.","['blood and hemopoietic system', '  diagnosis', '  electroretinogram', '  heredity', '  human', '  neovascularization (pathology)', '  peripheral vascular system', '  priority journal', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  visual system', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Electroretinography', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Humans', '  Neovascularization', ' Pathologic', '  Retina', '  Retinal Diseases']",18.0,,English,Article,['United States'],"[National Heart, Blood Institute, National Eye Institute]",['United States'],1984 - 1993,1

630,"Pentoxifylline: A Review of its Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic Properties, and its Therapeutic Efficacy",1987,Drugs,"Synopsis Pentoxifylline1(oxpentifylline) is an orally active haemorheological agent for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease and a number of other conditions involving a defective regional microcirculation. Pentoxifylline acts primarily by increasing red blood cell deformability, by reducing blood viscosity and by decreasing the potential for platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. Extensive open and placebo-controlled studies have shown that pentoxifylline 600 to 1200 mg/day for at least 6 weeks is associated with subjective and objective improvements in 60 to 100% of patients with peripheral vascular disease. The most commonly assessed clinical parameter, walking distance, is usually improved by about 100%, although much greater improvements have also been documented. Other parameters which have been clearly improved include lower limb rest pain, paraesthesia, muscle blood flow, cramps and leg ulcers. Pentoxifylline has produced consistently better results than placebo, and in those studies using comparative drugs, better results than nylidrin, adenosine and naftidrofuryl. In patients with cerebrovascular disorders, open studies with pentoxifylline, usually at a dosage of 600 to 1200 mg/day (300 to 600 mg/day in Japan), have shown marked overall clinical improvements in about 85% of patients. Symptomatic improvements in rehabilitation psychometric tests, neuromotor and speech deficits and other subjective symptoms have accompanied increased cerebral blood flow, particularly to ischaemic areas. Pentoxifylline would appear to be useful in most types of cerebrovascular disease including transient ischaemic attacks, sequelae of cerebral thrombosis and haemorrhage, and chronic ischaemic disorders. In patients with chronic cerebrovascular disease pentoxifylline 600 to 1200 mg/day conferred significant clinical benefit compared with placebo and in isolated studies proved to be superior to drugs such as co-dergocrine mesylate, adenosine and pyrithioxine. Preliminary studies indicate that pentoxifylline may also prove useful in vaso-occlusive crises of sickle cell disease, some hearing disorders, disorders of eye circulation, high altitude sickness and asthenozoospermia. Pentoxifylline is usually well tolerated when administered as the conventional controlled release formulation, gastrointestinal symptoms (about 3%) being the most common complaint, although these and other adverse effects have not occurred to a significantly greater extent than with placebo. Thus, pentoxifylline offers a well-tolerated and effective alternative to the treatment options available for patients with peripheral vascular disease. In cerebrovascular disease its relative place in therapy remains to be clarified with further comparative data. Pharmacodynamic Studies The primary pharmacodynamic effects of pentoxifylline are due to increased red blood cell deformability and to decreased blood viscosity. The increased deformability of erythrocytes has been clearly demonstrated in both in vitro and ex vivo studies involving blood from patients with peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease and a number of other conditions. The mechanism by which this is achieved has been shown to involve increased erythrocyte ATP and other cyclic nucleotide levels. Ex vivo studies have shown pentoxifylline to significantly reduce whole blood viscosity, and plasma viscosity by decreasing plasma fibrinogen concentrations. Pentoxifylline also strongly inhibits spontaneous and induced platelet aggregation in vitro and in vivo via inhibition of membrane-bound phosphodiesterase (leading to raised cAMP levels) and thromboxane synthesis, and increased prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2) synthesis. Platelet adhesion to vessel walls has been decreased with pentoxifylline in animals fed a high cholesterol diet, in a variety of tumour cell lines, and in patients with circulatory disorders. Experimental thrombus formation, either by stenosis or laser treatment, is also decreased with pentoxifylline. Peripheral blood flow in the lower limbs and in the cerebral circulation is usually significantly increased after administration of pentoxifylline to patients. There is evidence to suggest that most benefit is obtained in ischaemic tissue and that it occurs without causing a ‘steal effect’. There are usually no effects on systemic blood pressure or heart rate and little evidence for a direct vasodilatory action with pentoxifylline after oral administration to patients. However, intravenous doses in animals have caused hypotension and decreased vascular tone in some studies. Pentoxifylline produced increases in tissue oxygen tension in ischaemic lower limb muscles, in cerebral cortex, and in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with cerebrovascular disease. In animal studies, pentoxifylline increased cerebral oxygen consumption and glucose utilisation, increased cerebral cyclic nucleotide levels and decreased oedema formation. Pentoxifylline may produce favourable effects on electroencephalographic recordings in patients with cerebrovascular disease. In most studies, pentoxifylline has had either beneficial or no effects on blood sugar and lipid metabolism in healthy subjects or patients with peripheral vascular complications of diabetes. Pharmacokinetic Studies Pentoxifylline is rapidly and extensively absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract both in animals and in humans. It is also rapidly metabolised systemically, with peak plasma concentrations of pentoxifylline (about 1100 µg/L) and one of its major metabolites (about 2000 µg/L) being reached at 1.05 and 1.8 hours, respectively, after administration of a 400mg capsule dose. Following administration of a 400mg sustained release dose (the commercially available dosage form), peak plasma concentrations of pentoxifylline and metabolite of about 300 and 343 µg/L were reached at 3.3 and 3.2 hours, respectively. Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as about 30 and 20% for the capsules and sustained release tablet formulations, respectively. However, recovery of metabolites in the urine accounted for almost the complete dose, suggesting that extensive enterohepatic recycling occurs. Pentoxifylline does not appear to significantly bind to plasma proteins and distribution was relatively uniform throughout body tissues. There seems to be no accumulation of drug with repeated doses. Metabolism is primarily by reduction, to form metabolite 1 and by oxidation to form metabolites 4 and 5. Several other metabolites have been detected but exact metabolic pathways have yet to be determined. Rapid excretion into the urine occurs — primarily as metabolite 5 and, to a lesser extent, metabolite 4. Urinary recovery of these metabolites accounts for about 45 and 5% of the dose, respectively. Patients with renal insufficiency show decreased clearance of pentoxifylline. The elimination half-lives of pentoxifylline given as the capsule formulation (used in clinical trials) and conventional sustained release tablet formulations are about 0.8 and 3.4 hours, respectively. Therapeutic Trials The results of a large number of open and controlled studies show that pentoxifylline usually at a dosage of 600 to 1200 mg/day for at least 6 weeks is effective in improving symptoms of peripheral vascular disease in 60 to 100% of patients. In placebo-controlled studies, overall success rates have been significantly better with pentoxifylline (59 to 74%) than with placebo (5 to 29%). Subjective symptoms are improved in most patients — walking distance, rest pain, paraesthesia, cramps, ulcer healing, oedema, cyanosis — as are objective measurements such as reactive hyperaemia, and oscillographic, thermographic, plethysmographic, scintigraphic and ultrasound tests. Walking distance improvements have ranged markedly from study to study; open studies have usually shown increases approximating or exceeding 100%. Placebo-controlled clinical trials have generally confirmed the beneficial effect of pentoxifylline on walking distances. Studies on the effects of pentoxifylline on trophic leg ulcers have shown overall clearance or marked improvements in 61 to 87%, with one study showing clear superiority over placebo. In studies where patients were stratified according to initial severity of disease, pentoxifylline appeared to produce better results in more severely affected limbs, although between-study comparisons do not support these data. In a limited number of comparative studies in patients with peripheral vascular disease, pentoxifylline has compared favourably (with respect to standard subjective and objective measures of disease activity) with most other agents. Pentoxifylline 1200 mg/day has produced significantly better results than nylidrin 9 mg/day and adenosine 7.2 mg/day, while a lower dose of 300 to 600 mg/day was as effective as pyridinolcarbamate 1500 mg/day and was superior to (recommended doses of) naftidrofuryl. However, in 2 studies comparing lower than recommended doses of pentoxifylline (800 mg/day and 300 mg/day) with buflomedil (600 mg/day and 450 mg/day), poor responses were seen to both drugs. Similarly, inconclusive results were seen in a comparison of pentoxifylline 1200 mg/day and flunarizine 15 mg/day. Pentoxifylline has been studied in a few trials in diabetic patients with vascular complications, and has been shown to improve the symptoms of lower limb peripheral vascular disease. Other secondary complications, such as retinopathy may be improved, although further studies in this area are needed. Blood glucose concentrations and lipid metabolism in these patients are usually unaffected or improved. In one study in patients treated with pentoxifylline 1200 mg/day or dipyridamole 150 mg/day plus acetylsalicylic acid 1050 mg/day after vascular surgery, reocclusion of vessels occurred in 10% versus 20%, respectively. In patients with cerebrovascular disorders, pentoxifylline has also shown evidence of therapeutic efficacy. However, few well controlled studies have been conducted, making it difficult to assess the relative efficacy of pentoxifylline in this therapeutic area. In one multicentre study 86% of nearly 13,000 patients showed clinical improvements during treatment with pentoxifylline 300 to 600 mg/day for 8 weeks. Significant improvements were documented for psychometric symptoms (disorientation, hypomnesia, loss of spontaneity, depression, insomnia — 64 to 78% of patients), speech disturbances (65%) and subjective symptoms such as tinnitus, cold extremities, headache, vertigo (76 to 87%). Stratification of these cerebrovascular disorder patients reveals improvements in high proportions of patients with transient ischaemic attacks (93%), cerebral infarction or thrombosis (85%) and in those with cerebral arteriosclerosis (89%). In a comparative study of pentoxifylline 1200 mg/day and dipyridamole 150 mg/day plus acetylsalicylic acid 1050 mg/day in patients with transient ischaemic attacks, 12-month follow-up revealed incidences of new ischaemic attacks to be 10 to 13%, and 28 to 31%, respectively, and stroke incidences to be less than 5% with both treatments. Clinical improvements correlated with improved cerebral blood flow. In open studies in patients with acute cerebrovascular accidents pentoxifylline therapy has resulted in improvements in gross neuromotor and speech deficits, and overall rehabilitation. Comparative studies have demonstrated that pentoxifylline and xanthinol nicotinate both produce marked improvements in motor deficit in patients with cerebral thrombosis, with parenteral pentoxifylline also improving memory performance. A somewhat higher rate of rehabilitation was seen with parenteral pentoxifylline 400 mg/day than with a combination of hexobendine, ethamivan and etofylline in non-haemorrhagic stroke. Open studies in chronic cerebrovascular disorders have revealed improvements in about 60 to 90% of patients, and placebo-controlled studies have shown significant benefits with pentoxifylline, with improvements (haemorheological as well as clinical) in over 90% vs 15 to 20% of patients, respectively. Vertigo, headache and memory disturbances appeared to respond particularly well whereas visual disturbances were less responsive. Again, clinical improvements were accompanied by increased cerebral blood flow. Comparative studies in small numbers of patients with chronic cerebrovascular disorders have shown pentoxifylline up to 1200 mg/day to produce superior clinical improvements to treatment with codergocrine mesylate 6 mg/day (70% vs 10% of patients), and adenosine 7.2 mg/day (100% vs 37.5% of patients). Comparison of pentoxifylline 1200 mg/day, dipyridamole 300 mg/day or a combination of the two resulted in clinical improvements in 67%, 67% and 83% of patients, respectively. However, in a similar study comparing pentoxifylline 1200 mg/day with placebo, piracetam 4800 mg/day or a combination of pentoxifylline with piracetam, significant clinical improvements were observed only with the combination therapy. Pentoxifylline has also shown some potential for use in a number of other disorders including the vaso-occlusive crises of sickle cell disease, high altitude sickness, asthenozoospermia (but not oligospermia), acute and chronic hearing disorders, and disorders of eye circulation. However, the encouraging preliminary results in these areas need further confirmation. Side Effects In placebo-controlled studies in patients with peripheral vascular disorders, the conventional sustained release formulation of pentoxifylline has been very well tolerated by most patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms (about 3%) are the most common complaint, although these and other side effects have not occurred to a significantly greater extent than with placebo. Discontinuation due to adverse effects occurred in 3.1 and 0% of patients receiving pentoxifylline and placebo, respectively. In patients with cerebrovascular disease, gastrointestinal disturbances were again most common, with side effects of other organ systems occurring in less than 0.25% of patients treated with pentoxifylline 300 to 600 mg/day. Dosage and Administration The usual adult oral dosage of pentoxifylline in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease is 1200mg daily in 3 divided doses with meals. Therapy should be maintained for at least 8 weeks. In cerebrovascular diseases the most often used dosage in clinical trials has been 300 to 600mg daily, although the currently recommended dosage is 600 to 1200mg daily. © 1987, ADIS Press Limited.

This, plus the relatively high rate of spontaneous regression, has recently served as cause to initiate new studies in an effort to define the best therapeutic regimen.

638,Alteration of the blood-retinal barrier and vitreous in sickle cell retinopathy,1986,International Ophthalmology,"Nineteen eyes with background sickle cell retinopathy, eleven from patients with SC disease, eight from patients with SS disease, and twelve eyes with proliferative sickle cell retinopathy were examined by direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, slit-lamp, fluorescein angiography and vitreous fluorophotometry. Calculation of the alteration of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) and estimation of the diffusion coefficients of fluorescein in the vitreous were performed by fluorophotometry. In background sickle cell retinopathy, the results show a normally functioning BRB in the posterior pole. Abnormally increased fluorescence values to the mid-vitreous (peripheral leakage) were found only in 3 of these 19 eyes, at the two-hour examination (all SC patients). Similarly, mid-vitreous fluorescence values at the two-hour examination were 4.19 ± 1.52 ng/ml in eyes of patients with SC disease, compared with 2.65 ± 0.56 ng/ml in eyes of patients with SS disease. All eyes with background sickle cell retinopathy, except one, showed values for the coefficient of diffusion of fluorescein within normal limits, indicating normal vitreous gel structure. In proliferative retinopathy, the mid-vitreous fluorophotometry readings were abnormally increased, correlating well with the extent of the peripheral angiographic changes (neovascularization).

639,Iatrogenic Choroidal Neovascularization in Sickle Cell Retinopathy,1986,Ophthalmology,"Fifteen patients (16 eyes) with proliferative sickle retinopathy treated with argon or xenon arc feeder vessel photocoagulation had chorioretinal (CRN) or choriovitreal (CVN) neovascularization develop. These patients were followed from 2 1/2 to 11 1/2 years with a mean follow-up of 6 years and 8 months. Clinically important late complications of the choroidal neovascularization included vitreous hemorrhage (in three of eight patients with CVN). However, in only two of these three eyes was there any drop in vision related to residual vitreous hemorrhage, and this was limited to loss of only one line of Snellen visual acuity. Therefore, treatment is not usually recommended if CRN or CVN develops after intense photocoagulation. Vitreous fluorophotometry was performed on these patients to examine the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier. This gave a quantitative measure of fluorescein leakage not obtained with fluorescein angiography. Midvitreous measurements, which are more representative of these peripherally located proliferative lesions than are pre-retinal measurements, suggest that vitreous fluorophotometry may be helpful in differentiating the higher leakage of CVN from the CRN. © 1986, American Academy of Ophthalmology, Inc.

With an average follow-up of 3.3 years, 33% of preexisting sea fans regressed completely, 46% regressed partially, 19% remained stable, and 2% showed progression. De novo neovascularization developed after treatment in only one eye (1.4%). Ninety-five percent of patients treated had a final visual acuity of 20/30 or better and only one patient (2%) developed a nonresolving vitreous hemorrhage requiring vitrectomy surgery. These results confirm the authors' previous report and continue to compare favorably to the natural history of PSR in which de novo lesions developed in 58%, and 12% of eyes ended with a visual acuity of 20/200 or less. PCRP seems preferable to other techniques in reducing the risk of nonresolving vitreous hemorrhage and/or traction retinal detachment, although randomized controlled studies are needed to conclusively assess the safety and efficacy of this strategy in treating PSR. © 1986, American Academy of Ophthalmology, Inc.

While neovascularization of the disc (NVD) is a common finding in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), to our knowledge only one other case has been reported of NVD in an S-C patient in the absence of other contributing conditions. PSR has been shown to regress after treating hypoxic peripheral retina with peripheral circumferential retinal scatter photocoagulation (PCRSP). The following is a case report of an S-C patient with PSR and NVD/NVR which was originally treated elsewhere with scatter argon laser photocoagulation from the vascular arcades to just behind the equator. The peripheral 'sea fan' and NVD did not regress. PCRSP to the zone of peripheral ischemia was then performed, and regression of the NVD and peripheral 'sea fan' was achieved. This case illustrates the importance of concentrating laser treatment to the zones of retinal ischemia to achieve regression of associated neovascularization.","['blood and hemopoietic system', '  case report', '  heredity', '  human', '  laser coagulation', '  neovascularization (pathology)', '  optic disk', '  peripheral vascular system', '  retina', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  therapy', '  visual system', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Case Report', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Hemoglobin SC Disease', '  Human', '  Lasers', '  Male', '  Middle Age', '  Neovascularization', ' Pathologic', '  Optic Disk', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retinal Vessels', ' "" Support', ' Non-U.S. Govt""']",18.0,,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],1984 - 1993,1

The etiology of ASS is unknown and prophylaxis is therefore not possible. For first attacks, attention has been directed to parental education to achieve earlier diagnosis. Recurrent attacks may be prevented by prophylactic splenectomy. A controlled trial on the prevention of pneumococcal disease has indicated many pneumococcal septicemias in children given the 14 valent pneumococcal vaccine between the ages of 6 months and 3 years.

Michaelson's pioneer contributions to the development and pathophysiology of the retinal vasculature have laid the groundwork for a generation of ophthalmic research scientists to pursue this exciting field of investigation. In more recent studies it has been found that, in diabetic retinopathy, branch vein occlusion, sickle cell retinopathy, and retrolental fibroplasia, retinal neovascularisation follows the development of retinal capillary closure. The capillary closure or nonperfusion has been demonstrated by fluorescein angiography. A working hypothesis to explain the clinical and experimental observations is that these areas of nonperfused retina are ischaemic or hypoxic and liberate a theoretical angiogenic or vasoproliferative substance which stimulates the development of retinal neovascularisation. In postulating this working hypothesis it is important to recognise, firstly, that this hypothesis remains to be proved, and, secondly, that retinal neovascularisation may develop from other stimuli such as intraocular inflammation where retinal ischaemia is not apparent.","['book', '  human', '  pathophysiology', '  peripheral vascular system', '  priority journal', '  retina neovascularization', '  visual system', '  animal', '  article', '  diabetic retinopathy', '  fluorescence angiography', '  history', '  history of medicine', '  ischemia', '  Israel', '  laser coagulation', '  neovascularization (pathology)', '  ophthalmology', '  physiology', '  retina blood vessel', '  retina disease', '  angiogenic factor', '  Angiogenesis Factor', '  Animal', '  Diabetic Retinopathy', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  History of Medicine', ' 20th Cent.', '  Human', '  Ischemia', '  Israel', '  Light Coagulation', '  Neovascularization', ' Pathologic', '  Ophthalmology', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retinal Vessels', ' "" Support', ' Non-U.S. Govt""']",24.0,,English,Article,['United States'],[],[],1984 - 1993,1

Identification of the vascular changes in the retina has led to the use of argon or zenon laser therapy to prevent progression of these changes to retinal hemorrhage and loss of visual acuity. Aseptic necrosis of the head of the femur or humerus is now successfully managed with the insertion of a hone graft or prosthesis. Exchange transfusions are believed to have prevented recurrent ccrebrovascular accidents. The use of prophylactic penicillin and pneumococcal vaccine may have reduced the incidence of sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis due to susceptible organisms in young children. While this progress can be said to have improved the quality of life of many patients, other complications of sickle cell disease remain as therapeutic dilemmas.

We therefore ascertained the prevalence of α‐thalassaemia in 53 adults with HbSC disease and related α‐globin gene deletion to the haematologic and clinical findings. Alpha‐globin genotype was identified by restriction endonuclease gene mapping. Indirect ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiography were used to document the presence of proliferative retinopathy. Bone necrosis and infarction were determined roentgenographically or by radionuclide scanning. Either heterozygous or homozygous alpha‐thalassaemia‐2 was present in 26% of patients. There was no relationship between α‐globin genotype and haematocrit, pain crises, bone lesions, proliferation retinopathy or clinical severity score. Copyright © 1983, Wiley Blackwell.

XXXIX Edward Jackson Memorial Lecture,1982,American Journal of Ophthalmology,"Retinal neovascularization is a serious complication of the retinopathy associated with diabetes, branch vein occlusion, sickle cell anemia, and retrolental fibroplasia. Retinal capillary nonperfusion, demonstrated on fluorescein angiography, precedes the development of neovascularization in each of these conditions. Our working hypothesis is that the nonperfused (ischemic or hypoxic) retina liberates a vasoproliferative or angiogenic substance. Although I have delineated the clinical and experimental observations relating to the hypothesis of an ischemic-mediated angiogenesis substance, other postulated mechanisms for the development of retinal neovascularization may be involved.

Peripheral arteriolar closure was observed in 14 (24%) SS children and in 6 (16%) SC children. Arteriovenous anastomoses were seen in 3 children, but proliferative retinopathy was not identified. Capillary changes often occurred in patients without confluent closure, suggesting that complex remodelling of the capillary bed may precede retinal nonperfusion. Discrete retinal patches similar to schisis cavities resulting from intraretinal haemorrhages were found in 22 (37%) SS children and in 9 (24%) SC children, but haemorrhages were observed in only 2 patients (1 SS, 1 SC). Vitreous opacities were common and were generally associated with retinal vessel disease. Retinal changes were consistently more common in children with SS disease, though the differences failed to reach statistical significance.

Of the 53 photocoagulated eyes, choroidally fed neovascularization developed in 21 within one month to seven years (mean, 32.8 months). This complication appeared in eyes treated with argon laser and xenon arc. In 11, neovascular tissue remained flat in the chorioretinal scar (chorioretinal neovascularization), but in ten, the vessels grew into the vitreous (choriovitreal neovascularization). In many cases of chorioretinal neovascularization, the only subsequent complication was local vitreous hemorrhage. Visual acuities remained near normal. The development of choriovitreal neovascularization was associated with vitreous hemorrhages or retinal detachment in six of ten cases. Final visual acuities, however, were 20/50 or better in nine. Photocoagulation in some cases converted chorioretinal neovascularization to choriovitreal neovascularization or seemed to stimulate further growth of choriovitreal neovascularization. We now recommend no treatment for most cases of choroidally fed neovascularization. Photocoagulation techniques for PSR should attempt to minimize the development of choroidally fed neovascularization. © 1981, American Medical Association.

Angiographic assessment of the treated PSR lesions in 54 patients followed up for a mean period of 47 months (range 8-65 months) revealed cessation of leakage in 44 (81 %), reduction of leakage in 8 (15 %), and no change in 2 (4 %). In the 41 comparison eyes more extensive perfused PSR occurred in 25 (60 %), no change in 8 (20), and spontaneous improvement in 8 (20%). Autoinfarction of PSR lesions in comparison eyes was observed during the study period in 16 (39 %). Assessed by visual acuity, there was no significant difference between treatment and comparison groups, deterioration of 3 lines or more on the Snellen chart occurring in 9% of the treated eyes and 5 % of the comparison eyes. Vitreous haemorrhages occurred in 8 (14%) of treated eyes and in 7 (17 %) of the comparison group. The most common complication of photocoagulation was choroidal neovascularisation in the burn area, choroidoretinal neovascularisation (CRN) occurring in 19 patients and choroidovitreal neovascularisation (CVN) in 12 patients. In 4 of the latter patients CVN lesions underwent rapid growth and in 4 were associated with vitreous haemorrhages. Other complications in the treated eyes included transient partial third nerve palsies, preretinal haemorrhage, haemorrhage confined to the burn area, vitreous haemorrhage, vitreoretinal traction, and retinal detachment. Statistical limitations of the present study dictate that the results be interpreted with caution. However, the complications of therapy, and the high prevalence of autoinfarction in the comparison eyes, indicate the need for a properly randomized study to define the role, if any, of photocoagulation in the therapy of proliferative sickle retinopathy.","['xenon', '  blood and hemopoietic system', '  case report', '  laser coagulation', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  therapy', '  visual system', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Choroid', '  Female', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Follow-Up Studies', '  Human', '  Light Coagulation', '  Male', '  Middle Age', '  Neovascularization', ' Pathologic', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retinal Hemorrhage', '  Retinal Vessels']",16.0,BMJ Publishing Group,English,Article,['Jamaica'],[],['Jamaica'],1974 - 1983,1

Spontaneous regression (autoinfarction) was present on initial examination in 33 (49 %) eyes with PSR initially and developed in a further 45 (39 %) eyes during the study. Development of PSR was more common in sickle cell-haemoglobin C (SC) disease, and autoinfarction appeared to occur more commonly in homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease. The two processes were delicately balanced, and some PSR lesions lasted less than a year before undergoing autoinfarction. Although the high prevalence of autoinfarction diminishes the clinical sequelae of PSR, blindness related to PSR occurred in 14/119 (12%) eyes. Autoinfarction closes the feeding vessels of PSR lesions more elegantly than, and without the complications associated with, photocoagulation.

720,Retinal neovascularization in sickle cell retinopathy.,1977,Transactions - American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology,"Neovascularization of the retina occurs in several types of sickle cell hemoglobinopathies and is highly characteristic in appearance. It arises in the equatorial plane of the fundus following preliminary arteriolar occlusions and arteriolar-venular anastomoses. Neovascular sea fans arise at the interface of perfused and nonperfused portions of the retina, starting during the first decade of life and continuing for many years thereafter. Although some sea fans undergo spontaneous autoinfarction, most show progressive growth and constant intravitreal transudation of plasma components. Traction on the sea fans and the retina results in bleeding into the vitreous, retinal tears, and retinal detachment. Therapeutic intervention with a variety of coagulative techniques is feasible and is usually indicated whenever sea fans are discovered. All therapeutic modalities are capable of inducing significant complications. This is particularly true of argon laser photocoagulation when energy is concentrated into small areas (less than 200 mu) for short durations (less than 0.2 second). With appropriate precautions, photocoagulation results in a high rate of successful obliteration of neovascular tissue. Both vitrectomy and scleral buckling are valuable therapeutic procedures, but both have disproportionately high complication rates in eyes with the propensity for intravascular sickling of erythrocytes. Specific prophylactic measures are therefore indicated when these operative techniques are employed in patients with sickle cell diseases.","['adult', '  child', '  differential diagnosis', '  fluorescence angiography', '  hemoglobinopathy', '  human', '  laser', '  laser coagulation', '  pathology', '  retina detachment', '  retina disease', '  retina hemorrhage', '  review', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Child', '  Diagnosis', ' Differential', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Hemoglobinopathies', '  Human', '  Lasers', '  Light Coagulation', '  Retinal Detachment', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retinal Hemorrhage', ' "" Support', ' U.S. Govt', ' Non-P.H.S.""']",41.0,,English,Review,[''],[],[],1974 - 1983,1

732,Retinal vaso occlusion in sickling hemoglobinopathies,1976,Birth Defects: Original Article Series,"Sickle cell retinopathy, in all of its manifestations, represents the effects of arteriolar and capillary occlusions. Increased viscosity of circulating whole blood plus the microembolic action of individual sickled erythrocytes contribute to vaso occlusion. Decreased oxygenation and increased acidosis develop and lead to further sickling, and further vaso occlusion. The cycle of erythrostasis that characterizes sickling throughout the body is also applicable to the retina. The transparent media of the eye permit direct visualization of vaso occlusions which occur preferentially in and about the macula and in the far periphery of the retina. Many of the occlusive episodes are transient. These dynamic events are simultaneously occurring elsewhere in the body but can only be visualized in the eye. The net effect in the retina is a remodeling of its vasculature, as some vessels close and other reopen. After the onset of arteriolar closure in the retina, affected blood vessels embark on a spontaneous, naturally evolving course of events leading to arteriolar venular anastomoses, neovascular proliferations, vitreous hemorrhages, and retinal detachment. The advanced stages of proliferative sickle retinopathy are most commonly observed in SC disease and in Sthal, possibly because these two forms of sickling have significantly higher than normal blood viscosity. Retinal vaso occlusions can also lead to blow out hemorrhages which may evolve into salmon patches, irridescent spots, schisis cavities, and black sunbursts. In some respects sickle retinopathy is unique, but many of its manifestations are similar to those of retinopathies found in diabetes mellitus, AC hemoglobinopathy, Takayasu pulseless disease, sarcoidosis, chronic myelogenous leukemia, branch retinal vein occlusion, retrolental fibroplasia, and Eales disease.","['blood vessel occlusion', '  diagnosis', '  etiology', '  hemoglobinopathy', '  major clinical study', '  retina blood vessel', '  sickle cell anemia', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Animal', '  Arterial Occlusive Diseases', '  Diagnosis', ' Differential', '  Erythrocytes', '  Female', '  Human', '  Macula Lutea', '  Male', '  Middle Age', '  Optic Nerve', '  Oxygen', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Retinal Hemorrhage', '  Retinal Vessels', ' "" Support', ' U.S. Govt', ' P.H.S.""', '  Time Factors']",42.0,,English,Review,['United States'],[],['United States'],1974 - 1983,1

However, peripheral vitrectomy is riskier than central vitrectomy alone. If visualization of the sea fans is sufficient, it is safer to close the sea fans prior to vitrectomy in order to obviate the need for peripheral vitrectomy; then, only central vitrectomy is performed. When sea fans cannot be closed prior to vitrectomy, peripheral vitreous is removed to allow early photocoagulation of the sea fans before they bleed again. Four case presentations illustrate these principles. Vitrectomy relieved severe vitreous traction that complicated retinal detachment in the fifth patient, thereby eliminating the need for a tight encircling structure, which can be poorly tolerated in patients with SC hemoglobin.","['major clinical study', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  therapy', '  vitrectomy', '  Adult', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Blood Vessels', '  Eye Diseases', '  Hemorrhage', '  Humans', '  Light Coagulation', '  Male', '  Middle Aged', '  Retinal Detachment', '  Retinal Diseases', '  Vitreous Body']",13.0,,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],1974 - 1983,1

In sickle cell disease it is well known that new vessels form at the edge of the peripheral non perfused areas, and the sea fan shaped vascular proliferations are secondary to the vascular occlusion. Similarly, as a result of the work of Patz and Ashton it is now well established that the vascular proliferation in retrolental fibroplasia is the result of vascular occlusions due to increased oxygen sensitivity of the immature retina. The role of the non perfused retina in the other vascular retinopathies is not clearly established. This communication sets out some evidence to support the view that the stimulus for new vessel formation arises in non perfused, probably 'ischaemic' retina.","['diabetic retinopathy', '  eales disease', '  electron microscopy', '  laser coagulation', '  major clinical study', '  retina blood flow', '  retina hemorrhage', '  retina neovascularization', '  retina vein occlusion', '  retrolental fibroplasia', '  sickle cell anemia']",28.0,,English,,['United Kingdom'],[],['United Kingdom'],1974 - 1983,1

During these experiments, color fundic and color fluorescein photographs were taken. Fundic changes included retinal vascular attenuation, blood column pallor, and decreased tapetal reflectivity. These changes were most likely directly associated with a decreased hematocrit and a generalized shocklike condition. 3 deer had a congested appearance in retinal blood vessels and tapetum lucidum. 2 of the 3 deer developed serous detachment of the retina. These changes seemingly were associated with severe venous stasis; all 3 deer died shortly after the experiment was terminated. These experiments yielded data only for the acutely affected deer. None of the ocular changes could be considered the result of chronic sickling because of the reversal of sickling that occurred despite continued i.v. administration of bicarbonate. None of the deer developed ocular changes characteristic of sickle cell retinopathy in human beings. The changes in human beings probably result from continued stress and prolongation of sickling, and especially from a multiplicity of repeated severe episodes of sickling occurring over many years.","['color photography', '  erythrocyte', '  methodology', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  retina detachment', '  retina fluorescein angiography', '  retinopathy', '  sickle cell anemia', '  sickle cell retinopathy', '  tapetum lucidum', '  theoretical study', '  Alkalosis', '  Anemia', ' Sickle Cell', '  Animal', '  Bicarbonates', '  Deer', '  Electroretinography', '  Erythrocytes', '  Eye Manifestations', '  Female', '  Fluorescein Angiography', '  Fundus Oculi', '  Injections', ' Intravenous', '  Japan', '  Retina', '  Retinal Detachment', '  Retinal Vessels', ' "" Support', ' U.S. Govt', ' P.H.S.""']",1.0,,English,Article,['United States'],[],['United States'],1974 - 1983,1

Clinical Considerations of Articulation with the Fankhauser Slit-Lamp Delivery System,1974,Archives of Ophthalmology,"When coupled with the Fankhauser slit-lamp delivery system and fundus contact lens, the optical radiation photocoagulator provides a xenon source with outstanding image quality in the central and peripheral fundus. This photocoagulation system can produce small, timed retinal lesions that can be precisely placed even in the perimacular area. Clinically, these lesions are indistinguishable from those created by a similarly modified Zeiss xenon photocoagulator. The optical radiation unit has successfully treated senile retinoschisis, von Hippel angioma, exudative diabetic retinopathy, subretinal neovascularization, and proliferative sickle cell retinopathy. Although it seems less powerful than the Zeiss photocoagulator, it is less bulky, relatively low priced, and generates little ozone. We believe the optical radiation unit, when coupled with a slit-lamp delivery system, represents a valid system for the photocoagulative treatment of retinal disease. © 1974, American Medical Association.

The Manchester portable diathermy machine successfully occluded all 29 raised RP lesions and 50 feeder arterioles in 13 patients. Anterior segment ischaemia occurred in only one patient who had advanced traction retinopathy involving 360° of arc of the retinal circumference before treatment.

An analysis of both series, together indicated that peripheral retinal whitening was associated with mild grades of peripheral retinal vessel disease in 84.3% and with severe grades in 47.4%, giving rise to the postulation that peripheral whitening reflects an anoxic change, possibly edema, whereas a reddish brown appearance characterizes retinal atrophy associated with more severe vessel disease.

784,Ophthalmologic Manifestations of Sickle Cell Thalassemia,1971,Archives of Internal Medicine,"Vascular abnormalities were studied in the eyes of 14 patients with sickle cell thalassemia (S-thal). Angioid streaks were observed for the first time in a patient with S-thal. “Black sunbursts,” which are seen more often in the fundi of patients with sickle cell anemia (SS disease) than in those with sickle cell hemoglobin C disease (Hb SC) were generally few in number in the fundi of patients with S-thal. Proliferative sickle retinopathy, which is much more characteristic of Hb SC than of SS disease, was seen in nine patients with S-thal. The retinas of S-thal thus resemble those of Hb SC more than SS. The hemoglobin composition of a patient's red blood cells can be predicted, to a degree, from the presence and type of certain retinal anomalies in sickling disorders. Overall clinical status is not usually as good as indicator of hemoglobin composition. © 1971, American Medical Association.

785,Natural History of Untreated Proliferative Sickle Retinopathy,1971,Archives of Ophthalmology,"In this clinical study of the natural history of proliferative retinopathy in sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease, 25 eyes were observed without therapeutic intervention for an average duration of 31 months (range: 6 to 77 months). A new ophthalmoscopic and angiographic classification allowed quantitative assessment and comparison of these eyes at the beginning and at the end of the observation period. Clinically symptomatic and significant stages of proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR) were frequently observed in patients between the ages of 20 and 30. All stages of PSR appeared to progress. This seemed particularly true of that stage characterized by spontaneous vitreous hemorrhages; ie, 28% of eyes had evidence of vitreous hemorrhage initially, whereas 44% of the same eyes had similar evidence at follow up. No proliferative lesions were seen to regress. © 1971, American Medical Association.

786,Classification and pathogenesis of proliferative sickle retinopathy,1971,American Journal of Ophthalmology,"The ocular fundi of 24 selected patients with sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease were studied by indirect ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiography. Based on these studies, a new, quantitative classification of proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR) was devised, which reflects both increasing severity of the retinopathy as well as its natural progression. The first sign of PSR is peripheral arteriolar occlusions (Stage I); 91% of eyes were affected. Peripheral arteriolar-venular anastomoses (Stage II) were observed in 85% of eyes. Neovascular and fibrous proliferations (Stage III), which develop from the A-V anastomoses, occurred in 81% of eyes. Seafan lesions are part of this stage. Vitreous hemorrhages (Stage IV) from the neovascular proliferations occurred in approximately 30% of eyes, and retinal detachment (Stage V) was observed in 8% of eyes. Pathogenetic parallels appear to exist between PSR and other vasoproliferative disorders, such as diabetes mellitus, hypotensive vascular diseases, and retrolental fibroplasia. © 1971.","['diagnostic agent', '  fluorescein derivative', '  hemoglobin C', '  adolescent', '  adult', '  article', '  classification', '  eye disease', '  eye fundus', '  female', '  hemoglobin C disease', '  hemoglobinopathy', '  human', '  male', '  ophthalmoscopy', '  photography', '  retina', '  retina detachment', '  vitreous body', '  Adolescent', '  Adult', '  Eye Diseases', '  Female', '  Fluoresceins', '  Fundus Oculi', '  Hemoglobin C', '  Hemoglobin C Disease', '  Hemoglobinopathies', '  Human', '  Male', '  Middle Age', '  Ophthalmoscopy', '  Photography', '  Retina', '  Retinal Detachment', '  Vitreous Body']",203.0,,English,Article,['United States'],"[U.S. Public Health Service, USPHS]",['United States'],1964 - 1973,1

#Some background
st.header("Rationale")
st.write("""Sickle cell retinopathy, a critical ocular manifestation of sickle cell disease, represents a significant health concern with potentially severe consequences for affected individuals. Despite its importance, the research landscape surrounding sickle cell retinopathy remains relatively limited, with a paucity of comprehensive studies exploring its full scope and impact. Moreover, the countries that bear the highest burden of sickle cell disease and, consequently, are most affected by sickle cell retinopathy, often face considerable challenges in contributing significantly to the research in this area. To shed light on this crucial issue and address the disparities in research representation, this app introduces a comprehensive analysis aimed at examining the trends in publications on sickle cell retinopathy.""")
